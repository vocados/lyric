</script><br> The Hamilton Mixtape <br>Woah, woah, woah, woah <br>Woah, woah, woah <br><br>Ayo mugshot, gun shot, dope shot, jump shot <br>Take your pick, but you only get one shot <br>Advice from a schoolteacher to a young tot <br>Applyin' a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox <br>When even role models tell us we're born to be felons <br>We're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon <br>And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin' <br>It's not fair that's all they can tell us <br>That's why I hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday <br>That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery <br>I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away <br>Or chalk it up as just another one that got away <br>So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics <br>If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it <br>My point of destination's different from where I was headed <br>'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it <br>One shot <br><br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>Yo I'm just like my country <br>I'm young, scrappy, and hungry <br>And I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>No I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>Yo I'm just like my country <br>I'm young, scrappy and hungry <br>And I'm not throwin' away my shot <br><br>When opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it <br>Answer the door, welcome it, let it in, or regret it <br>They said if you can't beat 'em you join 'em <br>I say, Forget it <br>'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed <br>Be American, express how you feel and take the credit <br>Don't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and <br>Take off, shake all the hate off, it's over <br>It's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders <br>Must admit, I'm feelin', um, kinda, um <br>Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher <br>Than a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize <br>I surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter <br>My nine to five describe your scribe, survive minor <br>Setbacks and take steps back from pied pipers <br>Be leaders, believers in yourself and mean it <br>I mean you only get one shot, take it or leave it <br><br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>Yo I'm just like my country <br>I'm young, scrappy and hungry <br>And I'm not

shot <br><br>Bridge Busta Rhymes <br>Rise up <br>If you livin' on your knees, you rise up <br>Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up <br>Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up <br>When are folks like me and you gonna rise up <br>Every city, every hood, we need to rise up <br>All my soldiers, what's good We need to rise up <br>We ain't got no other choice, we need to rise up <br>Rise up <br><br>Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin' <br>And been learnin' to be the type of person <br>To display how determined I get when I'm certain <br>Inside I feel that fire that's burnin' <br>Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin' <br>Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden <br>Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen <br>Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and <br>Before I ride in a hearse and <br>My breathing stops and <br>You'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth <br>And now I kill again on that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan <br>Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington <br>Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in <br>Wonder where Busta been <br>Feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win <br>See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment <br>To rise up again, that's the way I was molded <br>And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin' <br>Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it <br><br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>I said I'm not throwin' away my shot <br>Ayy, yo I'm just like my country <br>I'm young, scrappy
