<br>Behind doors I'm the man <br>Calculated and I planned <br>What a shame, it took a split for them to know I was your man <br>Got so tired of hidin' it <br>Head high with no pride in it <br>Guess I wasn't cool enough cause in our pictures we hidin' it <br>Everytime it went south, I be sleepin' on the couch <br>Hotel room for one, thinkin' what is this about <br>I took the good with the bad <br>Always heated I was mad <br>In our pictures yeah we're smilin' but inside I'm feelin' sad <br><br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good <br>You ain't do it all alone we took ourselves up out the hood <br>Yeah we made it on the rise ain't no green in my eyes <br>Cause we both went to sleep in the same bed of lies <br><br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you <br>How can I trust you again when I'm not around you <br>But when I'm down and out and it's cold outside <br>Where were you <br>And when you needed me I was always there <br>Now where are

you <br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you <br><br>Yeah I was a backbone, a little caught up in the light <br>All I did was hold you down, before it all you was my wife <br>Real life behind the scenes, all I did was really help <br>To them you just a billboard, I cared about your health <br>I don't care about the wealth <br>I ain't care about your fame <br>I ain't care about no flawless VVS's in your chain <br>I ain't sayin' I'm the best, no one will love you like I did <br>12 years up in flames, thought you woulda had my kid <br>Year 3 got engaged, now we movin' out of rage <br>I ain't never think our book woulda ended on this page <br>Had to watch you kiss Nas and pretend it's all cool <br>Inside I was feelin' like a motherfuckin' fool <br>Life revolves around a bitch show me a man that won't cheat <br>Said I was overreactin' but you did like <br>Said I was overreactin' guess you did like <br><br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good

bills <br>You remember what you told me when you wasn't on the pills <br>If the shoe was on the other foot I'd make sure you're straight <br>I ain't playin' kiddy games and I ain't fallin' for the bait <br>Tell your momma, tell your brothers, I still love them like my own <br>I don't bother reachin' out because it's too close to home <br>But now we're not together I don't feel you wish the best <br>Can't believe we not friends, smh, what a mess <br>That's between me and you, it was always me and you <br>We ain't do this off opinions, it was only me and you <br>Then you let somebody new come and whisper in your ear <br>Didn't think he woulda told you that was my biggest fear <br><br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good <br>You ain't do it all alone we took
