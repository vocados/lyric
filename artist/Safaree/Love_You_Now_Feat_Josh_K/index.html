the booth</br>We dreamed about cars that ain't have a roof</br>So I'mma fast forward to now</br>We in the industry now, look how it ruined us wow</br>Behind doors I'm the man</br>Calculated and I planned</br>What a shame, it took a split for them to know I was your man</br>Got so tired of hidin' it</br>Head high with no pride in it</br>Guess I wasn't cool enough cause in our pictures we hidin' it</br>Everytime it went south, I be sleepin' on the couch</br>Hotel room for one, thinkin' what is this about</br>I took the good with the bad</br>Always heated I was mad</br>In our pictures yeah we're smilin' but inside I'm feelin' sad</br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good</br>You ain't do it all alone we took ourselves up out the hood</br>Yeah we made it on the rise ain't no green in my eyes</br>Cause we both went to sleep in the same bed of lies</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>How can I trust you again when I'm not around you</br>But when I'm down and out and it's cold outside</br>Where were you</br>And when you needed me I was always there</br>Now where are you</br>Yeah, yeah, yeah</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>Yeah I was a backbone, a little caught up in the light</br>All I did was hold you down, before it all you was my wife</br>Real life behind the scenes, all I did was really help</br>To them you just a billboard, I cared about your health</br>I don't care about the wealth</br>I ain't care about your fame</br>I ain't care about no flawless VVS's in your chain</br>I ain't sayin' I'm the best, no one will love you like I did</br>12 years up in flames, thought you woulda had my kid</br>Year 3 got engaged, now we movin' out of rage</br>I ain't never think our book woulda ended on this page</br>Had to watch you kiss Nas and pretend it's all cool</br>Inside I was feelin' like a motherfuckin' fool</br>Life revolves around a bitch show me a man that won't cheat</br>Said I was overreactin' but you did like</br>Said I was overreactin' guess you did like</br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good</br>You ain't do it all alone we took ourselves up out the hood</br>Yeah we made it on the rise ain't no green in my eyes</br>Cause we both went to sleep in the same bed of lies</br>Why do people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>How can I

people you love the most always want to hurt you</br>I ain't playin' tit for tat, I don't wanna pull you down</br>I'm not into circus acts and I don't even like clowns</br>I ain't even gonna front like I never watch your show</br>And I'm still your biggest fan and I don't need a front row</br>Yeah I know I'm not perfect, you was payin' all the bills</br>You remember what you told me when you wasn't on the pills</br>If the shoe was on the other foot I'd make sure you're straight</br>I ain't playin' kiddy games and I ain't fallin' for the bait</br>Tell your momma, tell your brothers, I still love them like my own</br>I don't bother reachin' out because it's too close to home</br>But now we're not together I don't feel you wish the best</br>Can't believe we not friends, smh, what a mess</br>That's between me and you, it was always me and you</br>We ain't do this off opinions, it was only me and you</br>Then you let somebody new come and whisper in your ear</br>Didn't think he woulda told you that was my biggest fear</br>Did the good outweigh the bad or did the bad outweigh the good</br>You ain't do it all alone we took ourselves up out the hood</br>Yeah we made it on the
