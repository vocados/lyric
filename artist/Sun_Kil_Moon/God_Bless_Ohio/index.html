</script> <p>There you were, a little kid in the yard</br>I was a friend and a brother</br>There's an old picture of us playing cards</br>And at night we threw corn at houses</br>It was meant for feeding hogs</br>Later in life, I was playing Jimmy Fallon</br>You were getting chased by police through cornfields</br>And mauled by canine dogs</br>And when I go back and visit</br>It's like a ghost town</br>We travel around, and around, and around</br>Past the perpetually vacant Sexton house</br>Past the abandoned Molly Stark Hospital</br>And I think about</br>The old Mansfield prison where Shawshank Redemption was filmed</br>And I think about</br>The Alcoholic's Anonymous guys I knew in my teens who had been in and out</br>Past the old steel mill</br>I think about my grandpa</br>And that horrible nursing home</br>And the ugly tattoo on his sagging dying arm</br>I said fuck that, Dad</br>Whatever that is I'm never ever ever going to get one</br>My Dad is one of two left of his nine siblings</br>And when he's gone I'm gonna lay down in my bed and I'm never gonna wanna get out again</br>(I'm never gonna get out again)</br>I'm gonna be strong when I can</br>Cause if my little brother goes before me</br>Don't want to swim out into the sea and never come back</br>God bless Ohio</br>God bless every man</br>Woman and child</br>God bless every bag of bones, six feet under the snow</br>God bless O</br>God bless O</br>God bless Ohio</br>Just saw the news on my television in New York</br>Pike County, Ohio Massacre</br>If it ain't families getting shot then it's one thing or the other</br>Guy letting his pet lions loose in the street and putting a gun in his mouth</br>Young girls held as slaves in a basement by a guy</br>Until a neighbor ratted him out</br>Craigslist killers luring people by offering them work on a farm</br>Killed and buried their bodies out by Belden Village Mall</br>Stole their cars and credit cards</br>God bless Ohio</br>God bless every man</br>Woman and child</br>God bless every bag of bones, six feet under the snow</br>God bless O</br>God bless O</br>God bless Ohio</br>Oh, as sadness lingers</br>And the rain clouds above</br>Well, sadness lingers and the lightning storms</br>Rain floods</br>Oh, as sadness lingers</br>And the graffiti underneath the bridge</br>Well, sadness lingers and the old dilapidated barns</br>And the doors coming off their hinges</br>And in the empty downtown parking lots</br>And the lonely alleyways</br>And the foreclosed homes that once had kiddie pools in the yards</br>And cars parked in the driveway</br>Oh, but the beautiful things from Ohio</br>My mother, my mother, my mother, my mother</br>And my walks along the path of the Tuscarawas Street</br>(Of the Tuscarawas Street)</br>The beautiful children of my sister</br>And the blue herons gliding across the pond</br>(Blue herons gliding across the pond)</br>The black squirrels nibbling on acorns</br>The fireflies flickering on the summer lawn</br>(On the summer lawn)</br>Domino's pizza brings me back to when I was younger</br>When I was younger, when I was younger, when I was younger, when I was younger</br>These kids I hear outside my window</br>I was one of them, I was one of them, I was one of them, I was one of them</br>Now I'm the old man in the chair</br>Deep in thought in the living room</br>I'm that old man now and I'm grateful that I got this far</br>And that I've become him</br>And when I go back, we drive around</br>We drive around, we drive around, we drive around, we drive around</br>(We drive around)</br>The old supermarket we used to go hide behind</br>Is closed down</br>(Is closed down)</br>I was raised on groceries my mom brought home from their spring, summer, fall, winter</br>(Spring, summer, fall, winter)</br>Velveeta cheese and Wonder Bread and chocolate milk, and Salisbury steak TV dinners</br>(Salisbury steak TV dinners)</br>She squirreled away a few bucks along the way because she loved you and me</br>(She loved you and me)</br>So she could make sure we had a few gifts each year under the Christmas tree</br>(Under the Christmas tree)</br>At the risk of pissing my dad off very, very, very badly</br>She socked that money away from those grocery store trips without him knowing</br>For you and me</br>What saved me from the dark clouds hanging over Ohio?</br>What's chasing the dream, baby?</br>Who would have known</br>That the pursuit of love and music would have even bought me a home</br>Or'd have take me to Tokyo, to Tel Aviv, to Athens, to Reykjavk, and Rome</br>There is healing in writing poems</br>There is healing in psychotherapy</br>There is healing in taking walks along the beach</br>But never underestimate the healing of music, baby</br>Some songs are funny and some are sad</br>Some are short, some are long</br>There is nothing as healing and powerful</br>As the power of song</br>As the power of song</br>As the power of song</br>As the power of song</br>As the power of song</br>I was walking along the Hudson looking at the New York skyline on my break from the studio in Hoboken</br>Every pay phone I saw I checked to see which ones worked and which ones were broken</br>And in my head there was a melody going</br>Oh</br>God bless O</br>God bless O</br>God bless Ohio</br>God bless O</br>God bless O</br>God bless Ohio</br>God bless
