Like your hair, man. Gray."</br>He laughed and said, "Okay, okay."</br>I said, "Hey, I got a little gray too. I'm not picking on you. But please just tell the guy at Home Depot gray and let them pick the color."</br>Fingers crossed that he gets it right</br>It was a long weekend and I went to bed and I just woke up from a long sleep</br>I dreamed I was invited to Farrah Fawcett's house</br>It was a big, beautiful house somewhere in California</br>There were maybe ten people there, none of whom I knew</br>Though Farrah was older, she looked just liked she did in Charlie's Angels</br>And she was kind and a wonderful host</br>Her house was enormous with lots of glass and light</br>And a nice open living room</br>I took a walk outside and all the land around our house was rolling hills leading to the Pacific Ocean</br>The land looked something like a cross between Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur, and Point Reyes</br>With beautiful orange flowers for days and days</br>The ocean was off in the distance a bit but I walked down there</br>And when I got the ocean, it wasn't the ocean anymore</br>But a river</br>There were two couples fishing who didn't appear to know what they were doing</br>One of the girls said she caught a fish but was struggling to reel it in</br>I offered to help and she gave me the pull and warned me that the gear had been rented</br>The line seemed like it was snagged on something</br>As I was pulling, I noticed a small boat floating towards us</br>Holy fuck, her hook was caught on a small boat and I was reeling the boat in</br>I didn't know why I didn't think to cut the line</br>I guess it was sort of fun catching a boat and everyone was laughing</br>When the boat finally got to the shore</br>It crashed fairly hard onto a dock</br>But not too hard</br>Of all things, a few people were inside</br>I entered the boat to discuss the damage with them</br>They laughed and said not to worry about it</br>That the fishing pole probably took more of a beating than the boat</br>I thanked them and when I jumped off the boat the girl looked petrified</br>I said, "Aw, god, I'm really sorry to tell you this but the boat owners want to sue. They said there's quite a lot of damage in there, many of their belongings as well as the motor and some damage to the back of the boat."</br>She began sobbing and I immediately hugged her and said, "Nah, nah, I'm just kidding. It's okay, there's no damage. They're super nice people and they even offered to give you a new fishing pole if yours was damaged."</br>She said, "Aw, god," she took a deep breath, then she said, "Let's just get the fuck out of here."<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-02-17</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rock</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
