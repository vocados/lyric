<br>Suzanne Somers or Valerie Bertinelli <br>Or Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson, or Jaclyn Smith <br>Nobody watched Charlie's Angels without having a favorite pick <br><br>All I know is this reminds of the theme to Barney Miller <br>It wasn't intentional, just adding a song on the record for filler <br>Maybe this song will cause you to have a wet dream <br>Maybe this song will cause you to connect with an actual human being <br>And maybe you'll hear this song when the sun is up <br>Maybe you'll hear it when you're down in the dumps <br>Maybe you'll hear it on a Spotify stream <br>Your girlfriend'll say, "Eww, you actually like this shit?" <br>Break it off with you and leave <br>Or maybe you've already turned this song off <br>Or maybe you're playing it and going, "Check this out, boss." <br><br>Maybe you can't relate to this song <br>Maybe you're a millennial and you don't know the references at all <br>Maybe you'll hear it and say, "I prefer your older songs." <br>Or maybe the world has changed and I'm not that songwriter anymore <br><br>Sitting around, moping about the hardships of being twenty-four (being twenty-four) <br>I've heard old that stuff, that's great, and it's available at the Amazon store (the Amazon store) <br>If you like those steel-string guitar sounds and those old slow beats (those old slow beats) <br>That's cool, but be careful when you're walking across the street (across the street) <br>With those headphones in those inner cities (the inner city) <br>A car might hit you, you might get mugged by a thief and you'll wish that you had a clue (you had a clue) <br>Or you might fall asleep playing this album in the background <br>Thinking okay (?), this is a pretty nice sound (pretty nice sound) <br>And then maybe by the time it's about two or three (two or three) <br>You'll find yourself deep asleep, having a trippy dream <br><br>Just back from L.A. where I recorded vocals to the "Seventies" track <br>You can tell I spent a really long time on the lyrics, right? <br>I spent months on those, thank you <br>Anyhow, it's a beautiful spring day in San Francisco <br>And just as I sat down to take a breath, I heard something crash in my hall <br>I walked over and part of the ceiling fell off <br>And I was like, "Jesus fucking Christ, can't I get a fucking break?" <br>So I texted my building manager and she said a guy would be over to look at it <br>He came over to check it out and all of things I ended up hiring him to redo my bathroom <br>I've been in the building for twenty-two years and it's time for some new scenery in there <br>I told him I wanted a white tile with gray veins <br>My building manager warned me that he was colorblind <br>So I pointed to a marble top stand that's gray and white <br>He said, "That's brown." <br>I said, "No, man, that's gray <br>You know? Like your hair, man. Gray." <br>He laughed and said, "Okay, okay." <br>I said, "Hey, I got a little gray too. I'm not picking on you. But please just tell the guy at Home Depot gray and let them pick the color." <br>Fingers crossed that he gets it right <br><br>It was a long weekend and I went to bed and I just woke up from a long sleep <br>I dreamed I was invited to Farrah Fawcett's house <br>It was a big, beautiful house somewhere in California <br>There were maybe ten people there, none of whom I knew <br>Though Farrah was older, she looked just liked she did in Charlie's Angels <br>And she was kind and a wonderful host <br>Her house was enormous with lots of glass and light <br>And a nice open living room <br>I took a walk outside and all the land around our house was rolling hills leading to the Pacific Ocean <br>The land looked something like a cross between Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur, and Point Reyes <br>With beautiful orange flowers for days and days <br>The ocean was off in the distance a bit but I walked down there <br>And when I got the ocean, it wasn't the ocean anymore <br>But a river <br>There were two couples fishing who didn't appear to know what they were doing <br>One of the girls said she caught a fish but was struggling to reel it in <br>I offered to help and she gave me the pull and warned me that the gear had been rented <br>The line seemed like it was snagged on something <br>As I was pulling, I noticed a small boat floating towards us <br>Holy fuck, her hook was caught on a small boat and I was reeling the boat in <br>I didn't know why I didn't think to cut the line <br>I guess it was sort of fun catching a boat and everyone was laughing <br>When the boat finally got to the shore <br>It crashed fairly hard onto a dock <br>But not too hard <br>Of all things, a few people were inside <br>I entered the boat to discuss the damage with them <br>They laughed and said not to worry about it <br>That the fishing pole probably took more of a beating than the boat <br>I thanked them and when I jumped off the boat the girl looked petrified <br>I said, "Aw, god, I'm really sorry to tell you this but the boat owners want to sue. They said there's quite a lot of damage in there, many of their belongings as well as the motor and some damage to the back of the boat." <br>She began sobbing and I immediately hugged her and said, "Nah, nah, I'm just kidding. It's okay, there's no damage. They're super nice people and they even offered to give you a new fishing pole if yours was damaged." <br>She said, "Aw, god," she took a deep breath, then she said, "Let's just get the fuck out of here." </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
