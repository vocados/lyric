</script><br> Scenic drive from Auburn to Diamond Springs <br>American River sparkles under the bridge on this fine day of spring <br>To the Sutter's Fort where they discovered gold to the right rolling vineyards and apple orchards <br>I just passed the bridge and the sign for the town Cool <br>No, but that sign was the last for the Tim Mooney ever took <br>Before he left the world back in Nevada City <br>It was the summer where we cried for his wife and his daughter Dixie <br>Second day of April home still decorated Christmas-y <br>The front lawn's been cut and the backyard has a fallen tree <br>Tomorrow my yard guy's gonna get back there and cut it to pieces <br>I'm on the front porch staring at this old dusty bible and I'm writing lyrics <br>And on the floors, an old Perloid accordion made by Honer <br>Three gas lamps, two antique, and the other faux <br>And I'm out here and it feels good <br>(In this moment) in this moment <br>Writing words on my big, black Victorian wrap-around porch <br><br>Next we gotta be leaving maybe slightly but not so sadly gonna see Manny Pacquiao fight against Timothy Bradley <br>Where I predict Manny will lose by decision, suffering him to the fourth, five brains bashed in, his hangarounds keep winning <br>Then I'm going down to New Orleans for Gulf Coast oysters <br>That's right, baby, I'm living my dream <br>For the first moment I ever picked up guitar I knew my life would go down a different road than the kid next door <br><br>I hear the birds outside tweet, tweet, tweeting <br>And the cars along the highway off in the distance <br>I hear an owl up in the tree hoot, hoot, hoot, hooting <br>I hear a Spanish radio in the basement talk, talk, talking <br><br>I smell the sardine can from the meal I've just eaten <br>Gonna put this pen down, stare off into the sky, dreaming with my heart is the world's biggest smile <br>For the hell of it I'm gonna read a random passage from the Bible <br>It's been in this house since the first I owned it <br>It was laying open, swear I'd never touch it but my housekeeper picked it up and closed it <br>So here we go, gonna read just a bit of it <br>Then look off into the pines and let my mind drift <br><br>Chapter 9, St. Luke <br>Christ sends forth his apostles, feeds five thousand with five loaves, is transfigured and casts out a devil. <br>Then calling together the twelve apostles, he gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. <br>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And he said to them: <br>Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. <br>And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there, and depart not from thence. <br>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them <br>And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere <br><br>So there I was, I read a part of the book of Jesus <br>Now I'm eating sunflower seeds and chili lemon peanuts <br>Sipped on a bottle of Glacau smartwater <br>And fell asleep until from upstairs my girl woke me up when she hollered <br><br>12:45 AM <br>SNL, Gwen Stefani, and the short actor guy actor, what's his name? <br>We are the beautiful dead and the beautiful night <br>I love my girl and my home and this miracle of life <br><br>1:04 AM, Vdara Hotel <br>Room 14015, April 9, 2016 <br>Our day started today with many kisses <br>You were on your way out the door to Southern California 'til the fourteenth <br>And I was on my way to Las Vegas, then to New Orleans <br>When you said bye and closed my apartment door behind you <br>A heavy feeling fell upon me, it hit me in a very real way <br>That we'll live the rest of our lives together <br>And that gives me so much happiness and comfort <br>But it also hit me harder than ever before that one day we'll say goodbye for a final time <br>Every day we get closer and closer to death <br>I have no illusions of an afterlife <br>And have no idea how much longer I have on this planet <br>Or what my quality of life will be in five, ten, fifteen years <br>Where will our final goodbye be? What condition will I be in? <br>And how will your health be? Are we even sure we'll be in the same place when one of us has to go? <br>I don't like goodbyes <br>I've had enough last goodbyes with people to know that it's the most painful emotion in the world <br>I don't want to live for eternity, life is filled with too much sorrow <br>My mind keeps flashing to a woman I saw recently <br>Of her and her son asleep in the car on the Tenderloin on a very hot day <br>They were in a tollway zone and looked to be completely passed out <br>She had a big map open on her lap <br>But I knocked on the door and though she couldn't speak to me she was okay <br>My biggest hope in life is that you are beside me when I die <br>I've lived many lifetimes in forty-nine years <br>But the best time of my life is of my days and years spent with you <br>I'm getting older and my stomach is bloated and feels off <br>I burp too much, I'm that middle-aged guy with a gut that I never thought I'd be <br>And here I am in Las Vegas <br>Family men with bellies bigger than mine are walking around with Guns N' Roses t-shirts <br>My elevator was shared with people who've arrived from the Philippines to see the Pacquiao fight <br>How many more times will I fly to Las Vegas? <br>I saw Pacquiao when he was rising <br>In San Francisco in 2000 at Bill Graham <br>Now he's thirty-seven and this might be his last fight <br>My money is on Bradley to win by a decision <br>That's why I'm here, to see what may be Manny's last fight, if in fact he does win <br>I'm getting older and Las Vegas is as wild as ever <br>But I'm tired and I hear the hum of a small refrigerator <br>My mind and my eyes are fading <br>Vdara Hotel, 1:03 PM, April 9th <br>Meeting Tony in the lobby at 2:00 PM for lunch <br>Just turned on CNN <br>"Paris terror fugitive is hitman in Brussels bombing" <br>I woke up at about 9:00 AM <br><br>Terrible nightmare that Caroline and I were being followed by this creepy lizard-y-looking plastic surgery guy I saw on the plane yesterday <br>He was following us to a hotel <br>But I was diplomatic, turned around, and told him we'd meet him on the balcony of some bar nearby <br>When we arrived and talked to him, he started throwing insults at me <br>And I knocked his drink out of his hand and into the street <br>He stayed there unfazed <br>Then I grabbed him by his neck, lifting him, pushing him almost, but not quite, over the balcony <br>I told him to go fuck himself and to stay the fuck out of our lives <br>He finally shut his stupid mouth <br>And as we left, Caroline told me that I was good with dealing with creeps <br>That was the end of the dream <br><br>April 10, seat 2E, United Airlines, Las Vegas to New Orleans <br>The fight didn't go as I thought <br>To me, the math added up to Bradley winning by a decision, if it went the distance <br>But Bradley was knocked down twice and lost <br>Bradley had a few moments and I jumped up out of my seat, threw my fists in the air, and got pumped up with excitement <br>But Manny was faster and countered him <br>Manny was the best fighter that night <br>We were in seat 19B, right where the fighters entered and exited <br>I felt bad for Bradley when he passed <br>His trainer Teddy Atlas looked deflated, yet stoic at the same time as he exited <br>Manny's mother and his wife were all smiles when they exited <br>I sat in my chair for a long time after the fight, hemming and hawing about the defeat <br>I owe money on my lost bet <br>The fight hadn't gone as I predicted <br>And that's life </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
