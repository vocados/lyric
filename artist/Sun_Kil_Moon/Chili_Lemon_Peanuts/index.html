And he said to them:</br>Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.</br>And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there, and depart not from thence.</br>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them</br>And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere</br>So there I was, I read a part of the book of Jesus</br>Now I'm eating sunflower seeds and chili lemon peanuts</br>Sipped on a bottle of Glacau smartwater</br>And fell asleep until from upstairs my girl woke me up when she hollered</br>12:45 AM</br>SNL, Gwen Stefani, and the short actor guy actor, what's his name?</br>We are the beautiful dead and the beautiful night</br>I love my girl and my home and this miracle of life</br>1:04 AM, Vdara Hotel</br>Room 14015, April 9, 2016</br>Our day started today with many kisses</br>You were on your way out the door to Southern California 'til the fourteenth</br>And I was on my way to Las Vegas, then to New Orleans</br>When you said bye and closed my apartment door behind you</br>A heavy feeling fell upon me, it hit me in a very real way</br>That we'll live the rest of our lives together</br>And that gives me so much happiness and comfort</br>But it also hit me harder than ever before that one day we'll say goodbye for a final time</br>Every day we get closer and closer to death</br>I have no illusions of an afterlife</br>And have no idea how much longer I have on this planet</br>Or what my quality of life will be in five, ten, fifteen years</br>Where will our final goodbye be? What condition will I be in?</br>And how will your health be? Are we even sure we'll be in the same place when one of us has to go?</br>I don't like goodbyes</br>I've had enough last goodbyes with people to know that it's the most painful emotion in the world</br>I don't want to live for eternity, life is filled with too much sorrow</br>My mind keeps flashing to a woman I saw recently</br>Of her and her son asleep in the car on the Tenderloin on a very hot day</br>They were in a tollway zone and looked to be completely passed out</br>She had a big map open on her lap</br>But I knocked on the door and though she couldn't speak to me she was okay</br>My biggest hope in life is that you are beside me when I die</br>I've lived many lifetimes in forty-nine years</br>But the best time of my life is of my days and years spent with you</br>I'm getting older and my stomach is bloated and feels off</br>I burp too much, I'm that middle-aged guy with a gut that I never thought I'd be</br>And here I am in Las Vegas</br>Family men with bellies bigger than mine are walking around with Guns N' Roses t-shirts</br>My elevator was shared with people who've arrived from the Philippines to see the Pacquiao fight</br>How many more times will I fly to Las Vegas?</br>I saw Pacquiao when he was rising</br>In San Francisco in 2000 at Bill Graham</br>Now he's thirty-seven and this might be his last fight</br>My money is on Bradley to win by a decision</br>That's why I'm here, to see what may be Manny's last fight, if in fact he does win</br>I'm getting older and Las Vegas is as wild as ever</br>But I'm tired and I hear the hum of a small refrigerator</br>My mind and my eyes are fading</br>Vdara Hotel, 1:03 PM, April 9th</br>Meeting Tony in the lobby at 2:00 PM for lunch</br>Just turned on CNN</br>"Paris terror fugitive is hitman in Brussels bombing"</br>I woke up at about 9:00 AM</br>Terrible nightmare that Caroline and I were being followed by this creepy lizard-y-looking plastic surgery guy I saw on the plane yesterday</br>He was following us to a hotel</br>But I was diplomatic, turned around, and told him we'd meet him on the balcony of some bar nearby</br>When we arrived and talked to him, he started throwing insults at me</br>And I knocked his drink out of his hand and into the street</br>He stayed there unfazed</br>Then I grabbed him by his neck, lifting him, pushing him almost, but not quite, over the balcony</br>I told him to go fuck himself and to stay the fuck out of our lives</br>He finally shut his stupid mouth</br>And as we left, Caroline told me that I was good with dealing with creeps</br>That was the end of the dream</br>April 10, seat 2E, United Airlines, Las Vegas to New Orleans</br>The fight didn't go as I thought</br>To me, the math added up to Bradley winning by a decision, if it went the distance</br>But Bradley was knocked down twice and lost</br>Bradley had a few moments and I jumped up out of my seat, threw my fists in the air, and got pumped up with excitement</br>But Manny was faster and countered him</br>Manny was the best fighter that night</br>We were in seat 19B, right where the fighters entered and exited</br>I felt bad for Bradley when he passed</br>His trainer Teddy Atlas looked deflated, yet stoic at the same time as he exited</br>Manny's mother and his wife were all smiles when they exited</br>I sat in my chair for a long time after the fight, hemming and hawing about the defeat</br>I owe money on my lost bet</br>The fight hadn't gone as I predicted</br>And that's life<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-02-17</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rock</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
