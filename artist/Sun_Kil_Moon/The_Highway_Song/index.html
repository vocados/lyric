Moldy, was brought into the town of Hangtown by Robert Lee and three of his men by stagecoach. <br>Moldy was reportedly bludgeoned to death with miner's picks by James Wang and three other fugitives, who, according to Wang, fled to Oklahoma. <br>Moldy had apparently slept with Julia White, the daughter of John B. White, copper tycoon of Butte, Montana. <br>Julia White was allegedly the obsession and love interest of James Wang. <br>Wang was hung in Hangtown on June 10th 1851 at 10:00 AM. His last words were "cut this rope, you bastards." <br>He was pronounced dead at 10:17 AM June 10 <br><br>Now I'm back on the 80 [?] <br>The Zodiac did a murder there, man, I'm obsessed with it <br>And yeah, a Hillside Strangler got married over there in Folsom Prison <br>I watched tons of videotapes on the guys and, yeah man, I'm fascinated with both of them <br>I drive down the 80, past San Pablo Dam <br>I used to pull catfish out of there in the summertime <br>Bring 'em home and fry 'em up in a pan <br>I drive down the 80, past Gentleman Jack <br>Past the C&amp;H Sugar factory, crossing the Carquinez Bridge <br><br>Now I'm driving down the 80 <br>I see the yellow fruit stand <br>I'm gonna grab me a bag of oranges and some apples and a bag of pecans <br>Now I'm driving down the 50, past Pollock Pines <br>Got me a log cabin out there right on the snow line <br>And out on my acres, got me a pond of ducks <br>Kid goes fishing on my property, man <br>Good fucking luck <br>'Cause down in my pond, tied down with a ton of bricks <br>Is a dead guy bashed over the head with a guitar and stuck with an ice pick <br><br>On June 10th, 2016 <br>Burt Clossin turned himself into authorities unarmed and led police to the body of Dad Rock Slowhand Simpleton. <br>Simpleton was an Eric Clapton impersonator who had recorded two albums in his forty-five years. <br>He was known for embracing a musical style known as yacht rock or, in other circles, dad rock. <br>Bert's log cabin was subsequently searched. His walls were graffitied with the word "Loser." <br>A small CD collection was found, including compact discs by Pete Yorn, Jet, Hot Hot Heat, Veruca Salt, Temple of the Dog, The Donnas, and Thirty Seconds to Mars. <br>All CDs were still in the shrink wrap, unopened, except for Hot Hot Heat. <br>Burt's flip-phone was filled with texts to a 666 area code phone number. <br>One to Louisiana prefix. All texts said, "Go away." His phone was also filled with photos of cats and payphones. <br>The objects used to kill his victim were a '59 reissued Les Paul guitar made by Epiphone and an antique ice pick bought at an Alameda flea market. <br>No other weapons were found in the cabin. <br>Other items collected were a 24-inch flat-screen TV, boxing blooper videotapes, a VCR, and sports clothing designed by Under Armour. <br>Burt Clossin is now serving a triple life sentence plus five years for the death of Dad Rock Slowhand Simpleton in California's Corcoran Prison. <br>Burt claimed that his motive for the murder was triggered Simpleton's singing voice, which, according to Burt, sounded too much like, quote, "The guy who sang "Wonderful Tonight." <br>"Wonderful Tonight," an Eric Clapton ballad from the album Slowhand was Burt's 7th grade sweetheart's favorite song. <br>"She dumped me," Burt told investigators, "for a rich kid with a pontoon boat." </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
