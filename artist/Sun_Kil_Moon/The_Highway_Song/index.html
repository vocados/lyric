Moldy, was brought into the town of Hangtown by Robert Lee and three of his men by stagecoach.</br>Moldy was reportedly bludgeoned to death with miner's picks by James Wang and three other fugitives, who, according to Wang, fled to Oklahoma.</br>Moldy had apparently slept with Julia White, the daughter of John B. White, copper tycoon of Butte, Montana.</br>Julia White was allegedly the obsession and love interest of James Wang.</br>Wang was hung in Hangtown on June 10th 1851 at 10:00 AM.

His walls were graffitied with the word "Loser."</br>A small CD collection was found, including compact discs by Pete Yorn, Jet, Hot Hot Heat, Veruca Salt, Temple of the Dog, The Donnas, and Thirty Seconds to Mars.</br>All CDs were still in the shrink wrap, unopened, except for Hot Hot Heat.</br>Burt's flip-phone was filled with texts to a 666 area code phone number.</br>One to Louisiana prefix. All texts said, "Go away." His phone was also filled with photos of cats and payphones.</br>The objects used to kill his victim were a '59 reissued Les Paul guitar made by Epiphone and an antique ice pick bought at an Alameda flea market.</br>No other weapons were found in the cabin.</br>Other items collected were a 24-inch flat-screen TV, boxing blooper videotapes, a VCR, and sports clothing designed by Under Armour.</br>Burt Clossin is now serving a triple life sentence plus five years for the death of Dad Rock Slowhand Simpleton in California's Corcoran Prison.</br>Burt claimed that his motive for the murder was triggered Simpleton's singing voice, which, according to Burt, sounded too much like, quote, "The guy who sang "Wonderful Tonight."</br>"Wonderful Tonight," an Eric Clapton ballad from the album Slowhand was Burt's 7th grade sweetheart's favorite song.</br>"She dumped me," Burt told investigators, "for a rich kid with a pontoon boat."<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-02-17</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rock</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
