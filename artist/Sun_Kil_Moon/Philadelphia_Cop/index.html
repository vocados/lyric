</script><br> Walking to my girlfriend's in Telegraph with a hand full of roses <br>Stopped through a corner store, on the TV a Philadelphia cop shot by ISIS <br>30, 000 people murdered in the USA in 2015 <br>And when I go in the studio later today we're gonna put up a mic and about this I might sing <br>See I don't give a fuck about things like who's the best or the worst on Twitter <br>And the other social media, money-making scheme turning you into a zombie <br>Jerking you off, masturbator, procrastinator <br>While the kids in Silicon Valley take your money and say, "Can we get the check, waiter?" <br>While they bulldoze your favorite building in town and turn it into a fucking fruit shake maker <br>You got the brains to be the next Norman Mailer <br>You got the longevity to be the next Elizabeth Taylor <br>You got the class to be the next James fucking Spader <br>You got the swagger to be the next Stiv fucking Bator <br>But are you sitting on the toilet staring at your phone like a perfectly tailored, made-to-order puppet <br><br>I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet <br><br>I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet <br><br>Okay, so here I am, back home <br>I'm gonna read another chapter of this book, Beatlebone <br>The part so far that's made me the most smile is the page that has multiple uses, uses of the word "wily" <br>That's me, a wily motherfucker <br>Come to Massillon and that's what you get, sucker <br>Gimme a one out of five, a big fat ten <br>Give me a two, either way it's all after me <br>And to all of you I say: <br><br>"Oh my God, you're a music journalist! Do you get to go to SXSW?" <br><br>"Yeah, pretty much every year. I mean, the magazine I work for sends me out there." <br><br>"Oh my God, that sounds like such a blast." <br><br>"Yeah, it's a lot of fun. I mean, it's super hard to get into VIP-after-show parties but, I don't know, maybe if you tag along I might be able to get you in." <br><br>"Oh my God, you get to meet the bands?" <br><br>"Yeah, totally. I'm friends with Jim James, Dr. John Misty, a bunch of people. [notification sound] Hold on a second, Sufjan Stevens just texted me right now." <br><br>"Oh, no way. I love him. So do you get to wear laminate?" <br><br>"Yeah, I mean it makes me feel a little self-conscious but, you know, you sort have to, you know, get into certain shows." <br><br>"Oh my God, that's so cool!" <br><br>Let me ask you: do you own your own story <br>Being pimped the fuck out like a pay for a hoe <br>If you're a man in charge, cling with staunch feminists and give a woman your job or shut the fuck up <br>"Queen Bitch" is a cool David Bowie song <br>And so is "Rebel Rebel" and "Diamond Dogs" <br>Can you hear me to talking to you, Major Tom? <br>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one <br><br>Should my girl be knocking <br>When we see each other everything's stopping <br>Yes who my girl be knocking <br>When we see each other everything'll be stopping <br><br>Oh, how

nice dinner at the Elite Cafe <br>Walk to the movie and decide to skip our plan <br>Came back, turned on the TV, and watch The Falcon and the Snowman <br>All the way to the end, where they're walking side by side <br>Ankle chains in prison <br>And we watched a show on the Mongols with Lisa Ling hosting <br><br>Then we watched some shit about Satanists <br>Taking over Detroit <br>I gotta say, Detroit being taken over by Satanists was pretty soft stuff <br><br>Now it's 3: 03 AM and the rain is pouring down <br>When I wake in the morning all I care about is that you're around <br>Now it's 3: 04 AM and the rain is pouring down <br>When you're beside me, that's all I care about <br><br>Oh, how I love you <br>Oh, how I love you <br><br>Woke up, went to the studio <br>Came back and turned on the CNN <br>David Bowie had died, there's a picture of El Chapo shaking hands with Sean Penn <br>Goddamn, like I said, we watched The Falcon and the Snowman the night before <br>With Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton <br>Bowie song played while the falcon soared <br>This isn't America, oh <br>This isn't America, oh <br><br>I woke up again, went to the studio and I <br>I tuck myself away <br>I sang a song in honor of my father <br>And I sang Roy Harper's "Another Day" <br>The piano, just like the nylon string guitar <br>It makes me sleepy <br>And I find myself in bed early for me, about 11: 30 <br>Bowie's face kept repeating over, and over, and over, and over again <br>A video of one of my earliest heroes laying in a hospital bed <br>And more and more, Sean Penn shaking hands with El Chapo <br>That motherfucker killed ten times more people than Jim Fucking Jones <br>That motherfucker killed more people than that <br>Plus Waco <br>That motherfucker killed more people than that crazy fuck did on the Norwegian island Utøya and Oslo <br><br>Go back to the other part now <br>Go back to the other part now <br><br>As I probably took 5: 00 AM, talk to a friend <br>Who'd met Bowie back in '97

down in LA <br>I played the song "Young Americans" over and over and over on the airplane <br>The song chugged along like a train, the backup singers wailed <br>And the saxophone sang <br>I'm in Room 214, Normandie hotel, Koreatown, Los Angeles <br>Me and my band played last night, we played David Bowie's "Win" <br>I think we did it justice <br>And I talked briefly about the first time that I
