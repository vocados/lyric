We're deeply afraid but see ourselves in circumstances that unfortunately urge us to have to cancel. The Sun Kil Moon show at Dachstock Reitschule, Bern, the open space in front of our house Reitschule, Bern is causing increasing troubles with violence and sexes. An organized drug dealer and the [?] we decided to shut the place down and its ongoing activities. For a while, at least ten days, or maybe longer and find a way of how to deal with our society's problems erupted in front of our house, creating a rather explosive atmosphere at times in front of our house. We're very sorry that due to this reaction the show with Sun Kil Moon will have to be cancelled. As we're in general enforcing this temporary shutdown, apologies for any inconveniences to you, I know your band just got into town. Of course we're gonna pay full agreed guaranteed fee as well as covering your hotel for 12/7/16. Also tickets will be reimbursed, it can be used to see your show tonight in Zrich. We strongly hope you reschedule your concert in Bern next time your band is touring in Europe. Reitschule remains closed until further notice. Again, my deepest apologies, but it's totally out of my control. Let me know if you need any more info <br>Sincerely, your promoter at Breathing Hope." <br><br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>And the sparkling Douro River estuary <br>I love Portugal <br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>And when I die I want some of my ashes spread there <br>I love Portugal <br>And skip the Hail Mary <br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>I'm gonna back next year and I'm gonna find that same shoe store <br>I love Portugal <br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>It's gotta be somewhere between the venue and the Fnac bookstore <br>I love Portugal <br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>And it doesn't have a goddamned thing to do with football <br>I love Portugal <br><br>I love Portugal, I love Portugal, oh, oh <br>I love Portugal <br>I love Portugal </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
