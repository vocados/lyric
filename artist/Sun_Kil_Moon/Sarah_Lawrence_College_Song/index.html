Even though we have a really small school and don't get much attention, we have a really lot of passionate kids. I know every single one of them is thrilled to have you come. Your music means so much to so many. I first heard your music when I was searching songs about Los Angeles</br>For a project in high school. I was fifteen or sixteen, and I came across "Cruiser" and it changed everything for me. It was the music I had been searching for for a long time. Some people say your music makes them sad and that you make sad music. I don't know, I guess I disagree. Your music was and is a comfort to me. I feel a sort of connection to it that is less a melancholic thing but more a reassuring thing</br>I was taking a seven-hour train across the state of New York. I listened to the entirety of Benji and Red House Painters I back-to-back. I thought of a lot of things when I listened to those records. And somehow it brought me ease to know someone that was thinking some of those same things. It was calming and even though I'm writing this letter before you even take the stage, I know the scene you perform tonight will be one of my most enjoyable moments. So thank you again so much for coming, I hope you had a nice time</br>And I hope this letter finds you well. Looking forward to the next record, the Jesu/Sun Kil Moon LP was great. And hopefully I can see you again on November 10th in Brooklyn. Best wishes and thanks again</br>Max"</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my</br>Sarah Lawrence College<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-02-17</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rock</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
