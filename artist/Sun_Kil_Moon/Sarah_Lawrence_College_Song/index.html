</script><br> Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song <br><br>8: 02 AM, April 25th, 2016, New York <br>Everything went fine at Sarah Lawrence College <br>While I was on stage I asked the kids to educate me on what exactly it is that they study there <br>A person shouted: <br>"We do whatever the hell we want" <br>I replied, "Well, that's what I've been doing all my life." <br>I asked what their parents payed for them to do whatever the hell they want and a girl in the front row said: <br>"$60, 000 a year" <br>I said, "Well, that's what Walmart pays me to use my music in commercials and that maybe I could go to their school one day too 'cause they all seem like really nice people." <br>I explained that Kirk Hammett from Metallica went to college after Metallica made it, which was met with a thud <br><br>A nice girl named Sophie played piano on a few songs with us because my mic couldn't reach the piano <br>She played the four notes on "Richard Ramirez..." and "Carry Me Ohio" really, really, well <br>That was a lot of fun <br>We also played "When Doves Cry" in honor of Prince, who died the night before <br>Steve Shelley played drums with me that night, by the way <br>What a great drummer <br>Steve's also a really nice guy <br>Great acoustics in the room and the show went really well <br>And we got out of there by midnight <br>What a cool group of kids and a nice promoter named Max <br>It was the first show he ever promoted and he gave me a check in an envelope, which I actually didn't open until just now here in my New York hotel three nights after the gig <br>This is what his note said: <br><br>"Dear Mark, first of all thank you so much for playing Sarah Lawrence College. Even though we have a really small school and don't get much attention, we have a really lot of passionate kids. I know every single one of them is thrilled to have you come. Your music means so much to so many. I first heard your music when I was searching songs about Los Angeles <br>For a project in high school. I was fifteen or sixteen, and I came across "Cruiser" and it changed everything for me. It was the music I had been searching for for a long time. Some people say your music makes them sad and that you make sad music. I don't know, I guess I disagree. Your music was and is a comfort to me. I feel a sort of connection to it that is less a melancholic thing but more a reassuring thing <br>I was taking a seven-hour train across the state of New York. I listened to the entirety of Benji and Red House Painters I back-to-back. I thought of a lot of things when I listened to those records. And somehow it brought me ease to know someone that was thinking some of those same things. It was calming and even though I'm writing this letter before you even take the stage, I know the scene you perform tonight will be one of my most enjoyable moments. So thank you again so much for coming, I hope you had a nice time <br>And I hope this letter finds you well. Looking forward to the next record, the Jesu/Sun Kil Moon LP was great. And hopefully I can see you again on November 10th in Brooklyn. Best wishes and thanks again <br>Max" <br><br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
