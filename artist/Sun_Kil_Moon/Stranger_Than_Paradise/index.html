Yes</br>Would I say she could have been pulled into one of the multiple shared bathrooms and choked out then dragged up and dumped into a shark tank?</br>Fuck yes</br>Would I say that she could have easily went up there all on her own and went for a swim? Yes</br>Would I believe even more a kid pulled a prank and is sitting back on a love in the soap opera? Yes</br>'Cause I see no evidence to support her death besides</br>Vague news reports</br>And one photo of what were allegedly her parents showing up</br>At the LAX airport</br>Talk of losses but no legal documents have I ever seen to support it</br>No lawyers speaking on behalf of the alleged Lams and no friends who ever spoke on Elisa's behalf</br>I asked a parking lot attendant who had been working there for ten years</br>"When that girl was found dead up there in 2013, were you here?"</br>She said, "Ah, I don't believe no girl up there ever even died."</br>I said, "Me either but can I ask why you think that, if you don't mind?"</br>She said, "You know how a little thing is said and gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger?"</br>And I said, "Yes."</br>And she said, "I think that's what happened next door."</br>I was completely with her</br>Caroline picked me up and I told her everything that happened</br>She said, "Cool, glad you got that out of your system</br>Now let's go check into a real hotel down the street</br>And get down to Manhattan Beach and say hi to Cameron</br>We're driving the 1-10, gonna say hi to a friend</br>Spend the day on his TV set and show some love and respect</br>We're driving the 1-10 and we stop for Italian food</br>And saying hi to Cameron</br>Thought that we're doing right and good</br>We talked about Bowie at length and he introduced me to Luke Wilson</br>And he said he liked my bass playing in Stillwater</br>And I said I liked you in Vacancy and Bottle Rocket</br>And we talked about James Caan and The Godfather</br>And Cat Stevens songs and Steve Miller</br>He said, "Man, I hope we get to work together."</br>I said, "Man, that would be great</br>It was nice to meet you."</br>We left the set and drove back downtown the Biltmore</br>As I feel asleep the mystery of Elisa Lam was still on my mind</br>Like what was I, some fucking investigator?</br>And she was real and for whatever reason her body was found in that water</br>I'm sorry for the parents and their poor, young daughter</br>I'm sorry for your loss, this world can be a real</br>Pile of shit</br>But I'm counting my blessed tonight, baby</br>'Cause we're both healthy and alive</br>So let's embrace it</br>Went off to the studio in Sherman Oaks</br>Laid down a few new tracks</br>Took a break, a Peruvian restaurant down the street and thought</br>The ceviche was the best I ever had</br>I told Nathan it was time for me to get on my flight back to San</br>Francisco</br>But wow, what a great weekend and...</br>On the way to Long Beach today</br>We stopped along the way</br>To see her brother and say hey</br>To his family and the kids spraying</br>Each other with hoses in the yard</br>And I thought about when I was young</br>And how the yard was so much fun</br>Oh, I thought about when I was young</br>At the Long Beach airport, waiting for the flight to San Francisco</br>Said I like this airport, it's not too fucking big enough</br>At the Long Beach airport</br>Waiting for a flight to San Francisco</br>I said, "Caroline, thanks for coming down. I love you."</br>She said, "I had a good time and I love you too."<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-02-17</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rock</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
