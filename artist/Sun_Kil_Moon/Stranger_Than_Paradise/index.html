<br>Fuck yes <br>Would I say she could have been invited up there by a group of people to check out the view? Yes <br>Would I say she could have been pulled into one of the multiple shared bathrooms and choked out then dragged up and dumped into a shark tank? <br>Fuck yes <br>Would I say that she could have easily went up there all on her own and went for a swim? Yes <br>Would I believe even more a kid pulled a prank and is sitting back on a love in the soap opera? Yes <br>'Cause I see no evidence to support her death besides <br>Vague news reports <br>And one photo of what were allegedly her parents showing up <br>At the LAX airport <br>Talk of losses but no legal documents have I ever seen to support it <br>No lawyers speaking on behalf of the alleged Lams and no friends who ever spoke on Elisa's behalf <br><br>I asked a parking lot attendant who had been working there for ten years <br>"When that girl was found dead up there in 2013, were you here?" <br>She said, "Ah, I don't believe no girl up there ever even died." <br>I said, "Me either but can I ask why you think that, if you don't mind?" <br>She said, "You know how a little thing is said and gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger?" <br>And I said, "Yes." <br>And she said, "I think that's what happened next door." <br>I was completely with her <br>Caroline picked me up and I told her everything that happened <br>She said, "Cool, glad you got that out of your system <br>Now let's go check into a real hotel down the street <br>And get down to Manhattan Beach and say hi to Cameron <br><br>We're driving the 1-10, gonna say hi to a friend <br>Spend the day on his TV set and show some love and respect <br>We're driving the 1-10 and we stop for Italian food <br>And saying hi to Cameron <br>Thought that we're doing right and good <br>We talked about Bowie at length and he introduced me to Luke Wilson <br>And he said he liked my bass playing in Stillwater <br>And I said I liked you in Vacancy and Bottle Rocket <br>And we talked about James Caan and The Godfather <br>And Cat Stevens songs and Steve Miller <br>He said, "Man, I hope we get to work together." <br>I said, "Man, that would be great <br>It was nice to meet you." <br><br>We left the set and drove back downtown the Biltmore <br>As I feel asleep the mystery of Elisa Lam was still on my mind <br>Like what was I, some fucking investigator? <br>And she was real and for whatever reason her body was found in that water <br>I'm sorry for the parents and their poor, young daughter <br>I'm sorry for your loss, this world can be a real <br>Pile of shit <br>But I'm counting my blessed tonight, baby <br>'Cause we're both healthy and alive <br>So let's embrace it <br>Went off to the studio in Sherman Oaks <br>Laid down a few new tracks <br>Took a break, a Peruvian restaurant down the street and thought <br>The ceviche was the best I ever had <br>I told Nathan it was time for me to get on my flight back to San <br>Francisco <br>But wow, what a great weekend and... <br><br>On the way to Long Beach today <br>We stopped along the way <br>To see her brother and say hey <br>To his family and the kids spraying <br>Each other with hoses in the yard <br>And I thought about when I was young <br>And how the yard was so much fun <br>Oh, I thought about when I was young <br>At the Long Beach airport, waiting for the flight to San Francisco <br>Said I like this airport, it's not too fucking big enough <br>At the Long Beach airport <br>Waiting for a flight to San Francisco <br>I said, "Caroline, thanks for coming down. I love you." <br>She said, "I had a good time and I love you too." </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Common As Light And Love Are Red Valleys Of Blood</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-17</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
