</script> <p>Came home from tour, it has been two month, I know</br>The summer is passing, I'm looking heavier, I know</br>Lay down on my bed I look down, my god my belly looks like Play-Doh</br>I'm almost fifty, I guess it's just the way life goes</br>Yesterday I got back into my better exercise routine</br>Laid off carbs, walked a few miles, I wanna be healthy and grow old</br>I wanna look good to you the way you look good to me</br>But I ain't twenty-five anymore, it's hard, it's just the way life goes</br>Turned on the TV and I saw on the news that in Japan a man stabbed to death nineteen people who were handicapped</br>My mind can't wrap itself around these things anymore, it's just the way life goes for some right down the fucking toilet bowl</br>I love my friends, P.S. friends the ones who love you back and most of all it's my family and you and your dog and your cat</br>Some have moved on and went down very different paths</br>I guess it's just the way it's just the way it's just the it's just the way life goes</br>Fog horns kept me up all night, you were beside me, I laid awake with jetlag and I tried to write</br>Talked on the phone to my foreign concert promoters, the cyclical way of life is a repetitive motor</br>When I'm fifty next year, I'm gonna try to pick my punches</br>Listen to my soul and try to trust my hunches</br>My body's telling me, that it's time to slow them</br>My creative calling will never stop going</br>Got me a house in the mountains and we rarely go</br>In this summer cause I'm always on the road</br>If I'm lucky at Christmas time we catch a glimpse to the Christmas snow</br>It's just the way life goes</br>It's the best part of the year, the glow of Christmas</br>The smell of turkey and stuff and watching movies and the candles flickering</br>I watch The Shining every Christmas religiously and A Christmas Story plays for twenty-four hours on TNT</br>Next year gonna try to spend some more time with you be the man I like to be and that's a better man to you</br>What's the year of (?) for once my garden out there in the mountains will stay alive</br>The disappointment is about where I stopped the song a few weeks ago</br>Then I left for Buenos Aires, got a bad cough on the flight over</br>Now I'm laying in bed the hotel classical, got a decent nice sleep and tonight is my show</br>Gonna kill that guy due every time when this life wants and when I write, Baby, I write</br>Gonna sing my songs and be back to you in a short time but I stop in New Orleans first, but I'm telling you, Baby, when I get home, we gonna be just fine</br>Sometimes when I'm alone in my thoughts, there is a war going on and my stomach is in knots</br>A lot of times on stuck on planes alone in my thoughts, wondering what the right thing is and what is not</br>Today I was alone in my thoughts, walked along the sidewalk, where this year Will Smith was shot</br>Will Smith the New Orleans saint, stupid, not the fucking actor, who were all times an inch away from playing a disaster</br>And of course I come back and I turn on the news</br>Look what happened up in Baton Rouge</br>The whole city is under the fucking waters as far as my cough and my travel was, gonna quit my bitchin'</br>Tonight I'm alone in my thoughts and at peace with myself, the choices I made and all the books and CDs on my shelf</br>Should have spent some hurts and sadness along the way</br>But I think of my friends, who have passed every single god damn day</br>And Caroline, your support and your love means so much to me</br>Every great man has a great woman behind him, who gives him strength and freedom to be the man, he is set out to be being</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond eternity</br>I love you baby forever and beyond
