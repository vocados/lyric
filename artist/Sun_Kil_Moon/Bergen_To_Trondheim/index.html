</script> <p>(It's twice, right?)</br>That fuck who killed fifty people in Florida</br>That's some fucked up shit, I don't care what ethnicity or religion that crazy fuck is</br>It's my opinion that he deserves a blunt object lodged into his temple</br>Smash his fucking brain in, of him make an example</br>That motherfucker's one of thousands like him walking this earth</br>Out to kill, maim, inflict pain, massive suffering, and hurt</br>Got me some friends down there in the Sunshine State</br>Got me a lot of love for them and I know that my love for them is reciprocated</br>So I'm gonna write a song in honor of those victims in Orlando</br>Gonna sing a song for them up in Norway, and here's how it's gonna go:</br>For all the families who lost loved ones in Orlando</br>There's a lot of love for you all over the world, you know</br>Cause all of you were just having fun, then you lost your lives</br>My thoughts are with you on my flight from Bergen to Trondheim</br>For all the families who lost loved ones in Orlando</br>There's a lot of love for you all over the world, you know</br>Cause all of you were just having fun, then you lost your lives</br>My thoughts are with you on my flight from Bergen to Trondheim</br>Christina Grimmie was shot by a stalker during a meet-and-greet</br>Just like John Lennon was killed by a crazy fuck at the Dakota suite</br>Just like Dimebag Darrell was shot three times in the head on stage</br>Just like young Selena was killed by the girl who ran her fanpage</br>Recently we lost the greatest, Muhammad Ali</br>Floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee</br>What would he have said about this horrific shit in Orlando?</br>Well the answer to that exactly we're never going to know</br>But he wrote the shortest poem in all the world's history</br>And that two word poem embodies his beliefs</br>He was giving a talk at a college and a student asked</br>"Ali, a poem please?" and he simply replied "Me, we"</br>Me, we, me, we, me, we, me, we...</br>What would Ali have said about that fucked up shit in Orlando?</br>I already told you the answer to that, we're never going to know</br>But I can tell you one thing about Ali</br>That I definitely know he stood for uplifting</br>To always exercize your spirit and your soul</br>I can tell you one thing that I totally fucking know</br>The USA better get its shit together fast on gun control</br>People getting killed in movie theaters</br>Shot in malls and nightclubs and elementary schools</br>Watch the cadre of crazy fucks setting machine gun [?]</br>There are only two people who can solve this atrocity</br>This sick epidemic that's fucking up our sense of safety and our community</br>There are only two people that can end these senseless fucking shooting sprees in the world</br>And the one who had the answer was the late great Muhammad Ali</br>There are only two people who can put an end to this ever-growing disease</br>And those two people are me and we</br>Me, we, me, we, me, we, me, we...</br>My flight just landed yesterday in the Czech Republic</br>Turkish Radiohead fans attacked at a listening party at an Istanbul, what the fuck</br>I can't say I ever liked Radiohead too much myself</br>But that doesn't mean I'd walk into a room with a crowbar and try to beat their fans to death</br>Okay, so it was a holiday and it was protocol to be fasting</br>That doesn't justify inflicting pain on those who chose to go out dancing</br>Ran three laps around my hotel in Dublin today and I saw a rabbit</br>The thing was so fucking big he looked like a baby kangaroo galloping towards me</br>Then he veered off and took a left and I look at the courtyard pond</br>Full of lily pads, mallard ducks, and koi fish</br>Why is this world simultaneously so beautiful and a pile of shit?</br>Every day is like a box of chocolates, don't know what we're gonna get</br>But I'm happy for the rabbit and the ducks near the koi pond that I saw today</br>And I'm grateful for the convenience store clerk that was kind to me today</br>And I'm grateful for [?] voice soothing my soul as I took a nap</br>The little girl in a balloon, flight or fought angel of death in Jail Break</br>And if you listen to Radiohead on holiday, that's okay with me</br>Whoever you want to share a bed with, that's totally okay with me</br>But maiming or killing because of someone's race, religion, or sexuality is 2000% not okay with me</br>And whoever out there with me does not agree, I will share with you one last time</br>The two word poem about Muhammad Ali</br>The only two words that can make change as far as I can see</br>And again, those words are "me" and "we"</br>Me, we, me, we, me, we, me, we...<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Common As Light
