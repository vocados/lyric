</script> <p>Two A.M., the birds are chirping outside</br>And they're keeping me awake</br>Outside in the backseat of my girlfriend's car, some old rusty window sash weights</br>Left over from the renovation down below, the old Chinese lady recently died</br>She's been living in the unit underneath me for 21 years</br>And has been there since 1975</br>Gonna take the sash weights to my old house and put them in a circle in the backyard</br>This winter I'm gonna plant an Italian Pine in the center and let it take root while the rain pours down on it hard</br>This week, gonna fly to New York and play Sarah Lawrence College</br>And dust my nylon-string guitar off and play a various selection of songs on it</br>And something I say will likely be viewed as offensive and cause a student to be alarmed</br>Or if a college girl is nice to me and I speak to her, it might be misconstrued and I won't be pardoned</br>Will a nearby voyeuristic blogger read purposefully too deeply into it</br>Go home, report it on cyber and tug on his dick, and wait for hits</br>Oh sweet tonight is quiet and the birds outside sing sing sing sing sing sing</br>And I'm still high from last night, I played with my old friend David J and some nice girls accompanied us on strings</br>And afterwards we rushed off to see Garland Jeffreys</br>He sang "New York Skyline," it was one of the most beautiful things that I had ever seen</br>And after that, gonna record with Nate and Steve in Hoboken</br>Nate called me yesterday, his wife is pregnant, I told him, "Man, congratulations"</br>Oh how things change, and that's an interesting part of getting up there in age</br>Seeing how we all grow older and how our lives and the colors around us change</br>When I get back, I'm gonna take a trip with my girlfriend down to L.A</br>Gonna stay at the Cecil hotel for a night, where an alleged girl, allegedly named Lisa Lam, allegedly stayed</br>It's been on my mind since I think the story of her death was possibly staged</br>She died at 21 years old in 2013, the height of the internet age</br>Yet only 2 known photos, plus the one on the elevator with the pixelated face</br>Not one press conference about how a Canadian's dead body was found on that February day</br>I once worked at a residential hotel with one fourth the amount of rooms as the Cecil</br>And the elevators and hallways were always active with hookers and pimps and drug addicts and SSI people</br>And I'm telling you all that elevator footage of Elisa Lam looks totally rigged</br>Six hundred rooms and no one walked down the hall and tried to get on that elevator with her</br>Who in the fuck do you think you're kidding?</br>Well I'm gonna check in out, I'm gonna ask for the room with the old tenant, Richard Ramirez</br>I don't spook easy and true crime is fascinating to me and that's my right as an American</br>My girlfriend said she's totally not into it but she's happy to take me there and drive me home</br>As long as in the morning we can visit her parents, and I said, great, I liked the bed in the guest room, it's nice and soft</br>Now let's cut some vague rock lyrics</br>Please please please please please please please please please please please</br>La di da di la di da di la di da di la di la di la di la di dii</br>I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all</br>I love you too, ghost girl in the elevator, hearing voices in the hall</br>Bon Jovi's seen a million faces, and he's rocked them all</br>Those are his words, but I omitted one, and the other two, I installed</br>You're not quite a million faces, but I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all</br>Though we are imperfect, though we are human, yes, we are all flawed</br>I see your face and I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all</br>I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all</br>I see your face and love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all</br>Though I am imperfect, though I am human, though I am flawed</br>I see all your faces and love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all</br>I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all</br>I love you all, I love you
