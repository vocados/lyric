<br>Mushed against your damn side <br>your puss <br>And thighs are squished <br>What kind of attire's that <br>I'm ready to be rode <br>Psychopath bet you we'll get it <br>poppin' like a flat <br>Light the match to ignite the wrath <br>Got knives to slash <br>and slice hermaphrodites in half <br>Piper Chapmans might <br>just have to picket me <br>Like a scab <br>Hard to describe in fact <br>Startling violent perhaps <br>Are things that come to mind <br>as soon as I start spitting <br>rhymes like that <br>And you aren't really <br>surprised at that <br>But as far as these lines I rap
