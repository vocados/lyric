</script><br> Man, I been independent, not pretendin' <br>Not dependent on your friendship <br>Or connection, I'm the only one I need <br>I used to think I really needed managers <br>I don't need no assistants <br>I'm persistent plus consistent, you're resistant <br>Bro, you must be out your mind, ho <br>Seven years independent now, where the fuck did the time go <br>Chasing cheese, these mice <br>They can't see me, take off your blindfold <br>They act like they don't feel me <br>Touch my texture, want my net worth <br>Wanna network, I don't need you, I'm an expert <br>Last week, I met this girl outside of SuperCuts <br>Said she went to my high school <br>And she wants to make it at music stuff <br>She said, I wanna do what you do, Spiz <br>I wanna make my dreams come true <br>But I don't got a deal on the table from a label <br>I said, You don't need a label, are you kidding me <br><br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>To make your dreams come true <br>You don't need no fucking crew <br>All you need is <br><br>Self-reliance, you should try it <br>A true survivor on some Do or Die shit <br>No hand-outs, no crucifyin' <br>Against all odds like a rooster flyin' <br>I'm moving by and you fading back <br>Figured out my own way to rap <br>Record a verse then play it back <br>Put it out and get paid a stack <br>Like every boss I've had, man, I couldn't help avoid <br>Like my mental health, destroyed <br>This is why I'm self-employed <br>There's a fine line between a proposition and a ploy <br>I don't plan on stoppin' till my opposition is destroyed <br>Man, I'm in D like semen, even in dreams, I'm schemin' <br>I stay ten feet for a reason, even friends be deceivin' <br>Yo, my pen be prestigious, so that envy, I don't need it <br>I got plenty of genius while you empty and depleted <br>I don't need no one to tell me how to do my thang <br>Fuck it, I'ma stop rapping and I'll try to sing <br>I don't need no one to tell me what the fuck to do <br>I'ma keep it true so, all you, all you, all you need is <br><br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>Nobody but myself, no, no, no <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>Need nobody else, have nobody else <br>I said all you need is <br><br>The person your mom made <br>To take a big leap, lil sleep, work long days <br>All you need is balls to go out and risk it all <br>If you want the money tall, wanna blow like Pompeii <br>Other people put the lyin' in relyin' <br>I'm relyin' on compliant Ryan drivin' on a wrong way <br>Tryna get it in like a prom date <br>Tryna make my pockets go from concave to Ariana Grande <br>All you need is all you got, I'm all I got, got bigger plans <br>My life is in my hands, damn, I need some bigger hands <br>It's out of Maine, this doubted train, I think I can, I think I can <br>My ink and pen made simple, man, feel Jigga man <br>You think I can't, bro, think again <br>Bring 'em in, gentlemen, simpletons, invalids <br>You wouldn't risk it Cash <br>I know you wanna be it but you probably didn't see it <br>It was too far, your vision in the distance Too far <br>You might gotta lose your job Job <br>You might gotta lose some friends Life <br>You might gotta lose and then lose and then lose <br>And then lose and then lose again to win <br>I used to work with this rapper at the hardware store <br>One of the best MCs I've ever heard, this dude was raw <br>Told me that his cousin knew an AandR at a label <br>Who was gonna get him into meetings <br>I said, Damn, that's cool <br>Even it falls through, you can still make do <br><br>Because all you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>If you really wanna get up with that one you can't get rid of <br>All you need is <br><br>We independent, that's my fetish, I don't ask for much <br>I turn my lessons to a message through this rapping stuff <br>I spend my mornings cooking breakfast while I'm ashin' blunts <br>They used to call me borin' till they saw my money addin' up <br>I won't ever need no re-do, all these people see through <br>I be the youngest in my class but you should let me teach you <br>Oh, you wanna do what he do, well there's nothin' stoppin' it <br>Watch your step, see how far I get, swear all I had was common sense <br>And I ain't really that big, so you might not know me yet <br>Might fuck around and get rich, write flows down with my pen <br>These nights I never sleep through, I'ma make my dreams true <br>And everything I say always has a ring to it <br>These people playing, they say they my friends <br>I swear they all of 'em basic, see the face through my lens <br>You thought that I was a complacent, that's just a stupid guess <br>And even when it's raining, I ain't never feeling stressed <br><br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All you need is you <br>All
