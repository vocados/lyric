friendship</br>Or connection, I'm the only one I need</br>I used to think I really needed managers</br>I don't need no assistants</br>I'm persistent plus consistent, you're resistant</br>Bro, you must be out your mind, ho</br>Seven years independent now, where the fuck did the time go</br>Chasing cheese, these mice</br>They can't see me, take off your blindfold</br>They act like they don't feel me</br>Touch my texture, want my net worth</br>Wanna network, I don't need you, I'm an expert</br>Last week, I met this girl outside of SuperCuts</br>Said she went to my high school</br>And she wants to make it at music stuff</br>She said, I wanna do what you do, Spiz</br>I wanna make my dreams come true</br>But I don't got a deal on the table from a label</br>I said, You don't need a label, are you kidding me</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>To make your dreams come true</br>You don't need no fucking crew</br>All you need is</br>Self-reliance, you should try it</br>A true survivor on some Do or Die shit</br>No hand-outs, no crucifyin'</br>Against all odds like a rooster flyin'</br>I'm moving by and you fading back</br>Figured out my own way to rap</br>Record a verse then play it back</br>Put it out and get paid a stack</br>Like every boss I've had, man, I couldn't help avoid</br>Like my mental health, destroyed</br>This is why I'm self-employed</br>There's a fine line between a proposition and a ploy</br>I don't plan on stoppin' till my opposition is destroyed</br>Man, I'm in D like semen, even in dreams, I'm schemin'</br>I stay ten feet for a reason, even friends be deceivin'</br>Yo, my pen be prestigious, so that envy, I don't need it</br>I got plenty of genius while you empty and depleted</br>I don't need no one to tell me how to do my thang</br>Fuck it, I'ma stop rapping and I'll try to sing</br>I don't need no one to tell me what the fuck to do</br>I'ma keep it true so, all you, all you, all you need is</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>Nobody but myself, no, no, no</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>Need nobody else, have nobody else</br>I said all you need is</br>The person your mom made</br>To take a big leap, lil sleep, work long days</br>All you need is balls to go out and risk it all</br>If you want the money tall, wanna blow like Pompeii</br>Other people put the lyin' in relyin'</br>I'm relyin' on compliant Ryan drivin' on a wrong way</br>Tryna get it in like a prom date</br>Tryna make my pockets go from concave to Ariana Grande</br>All you need is all you got, I'm all I got, got bigger plans</br>My life is in my hands, damn, I need some bigger hands</br>It's out of Maine, this doubted train, I think I can, I think I can</br>My ink and pen made simple, man, feel Jigga man</br>You think I can't, bro, think again</br>Bring 'em in, gentlemen, simpletons, invalids</br>You wouldn't risk it Cash</br>I know you wanna be it but you probably didn't see it</br>It was too far, your vision in the distance Too far</br>You might gotta lose your job Job</br>You might gotta lose some friends Life</br>You might gotta lose and then lose and then lose</br>And then lose and then lose again to win</br>I used to work with this rapper at the hardware store</br>One of the best MCs I've ever heard, this dude was raw</br>Told me that his cousin knew an AandR at a label</br>Who was gonna get him into meetings</br>I said, Damn, that's cool</br>Even it falls through, you can still make do</br>Because all you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>If you really wanna get up with that one you can't get rid of</br>All you need is</br>We independent, that's my fetish, I don't ask for much</br>I turn my lessons to a message through this rapping stuff</br>I spend my mornings cooking breakfast while I'm ashin' blunts</br>They used to call me borin' till they saw my money addin' up</br>I won't ever need no re-do, all these people see through</br>I be the youngest in my class but you should let me teach you</br>Oh, you wanna do what he do, well there's nothin' stoppin' it</br>Watch your step, see how far I get, swear all I had was common sense</br>And I ain't really that big, so you might not know me yet</br>Might fuck around and get rich, write flows down with my pen</br>These nights I never sleep through, I'ma make my dreams true</br>And everything I say always has a ring to it</br>These people playing, they say they my friends</br>I swear they all of 'em basic, see the face through my lens</br>You thought that I was a complacent, that's just a stupid guess</br>And even when it's raining, I ain't never feeling stressed</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>All you need is you</br>I said all you need
