live large <br>Gotta save what you made when you tour 'cause it’s August and I ain’t made a dollar since March <br>Shit’ll make you go create a Kickstart page, dark days homie, I was really hit hard <br>Last year, spent 25 grand trying to help my best friend beat a serious charge <br>Me and my fiance been engaged, but to help him with his case, I was dipping in the paper that I saved <br>For the wedding and the family ain’t chip in shit, so I’m paying for the caterer, the cake, everything <br>And the dates coming soon, money doing down payments and all of the arrangements are made <br>Even though we’re going broke so excited to get married, everything felt great for a change <br>Plus I had some tour dates up in Canada and the wedding’s one month away <br>That’ll help to support us, Out of nowhere my world got rocked <br>With some girl I was getting blackmailed and extorted <br>Wouldn’t pay her, so my lady had to deal with her as torment <br>Right before the wedding and it ruined it <br>Honeymoon room with a gorgeous view, can’t enjoy it <br>We was thinking we was gonna start to live a <br><br>Hook <br>Good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life <br>Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like <br>Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life <br>Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like <br>Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life <br><br>Verse 2 <br> a world when you don’t have a day job <br>Need to take a vacation, instead we got a room with a aloft for a few days <br>Chef Chad hooked us up at the Steakhouse, feeling great now <br>My lady said it was okay if I went to bed, she stayed up <br>Got drunk by herself, had one too many, tried to walk, fell and hit her head <br>Good thing I went to check on her 'cause she was unconscious and drenched in blood <br>I looked and I could see the white meat <br>People staring while the paramedics pushed her through the lobby <br>Now they’re in the hospital hooking her to IVs <br>Sitting their drunk inside a , while they stapling her head <br>Then she got a CAT scan, came back and they said they found a hemorrhage <br>On her brain, and explained how bad her condition is <br>We were having dinner, this gotta be a dream, she just fell <br>Now you’re telling me her death may come in a matter of some months <br>We were crying, saying that we love each other and we wish we would have just stayed home <br>The nurse came back and she said good news, my fault, must have read the x-ray wrong <br>That your brain’s okay, you should both slow down <br>If you don’t then you won’t live long have a <br><br>Hook <br>Good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life <br>Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like <br>Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life <br>Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like <br>Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life <br><br>Verse 3 <br>Gotta separate your homies from your business partners and it’s hard to <br>Several times, severed ties with my friends who had done a contract and I’m caught up in a lawsuit <br>My lawyer said I’m gonna take a lose in the courtroom, Gotta settle it and pay 'em like you got loot <br>Conflict of interest, comes with the business, articles are endless <br>Tryna figure out who double crossed who, Followed by the devil in a costume <br>Thought you knew I loved food, cooking is my plan B <br>Now the doctor tells me what I can and can’t eat, said I’d have a heart attack <br>Telling me I can’t drink, can’t think without a pill, panicking I can’t breath <br>Pop a xanex on the couch, me and my wife both no job, no drive, both dying <br>Both drinking, watching time fly by, but we both die slow <br>Thought the money would have changed us <br>We was broke, , but we both know we lucky to be alive <br>Always wanted to be famous, wonder when we’re gonna wake up, appreciate the luxuries of life <br>And it doesn’t take a genius to see that drugs and alcohol took its toll, done it one too many times <br>Getting drunk and took a dive, like fuck if I survive <br>I don’t want to die, I just want to try to live a <br><br>Hook <br>Good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life <br>Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like <br>Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life <br>Who doesn’t want to live a good life <br>One day I’m gonna live a good life
