class="cover-heading">Different Breed</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Rittz<br><br> Ol’ ho ass <br>Bitch <br><br>Verse 1 <br>Uh, it’s embarrassing watching people go out back <br>Want to fight 'em or sucker punch 'em, I ain’t trying to go out back <br>Flow so outdated you be slippin' off shit like an old mouse pad <br>Run around like an old grouch bag <br>When you see me don't speak like a No Doubt track <br>Shhh, quiet motherfucker <br>I don’t recognize you 'cause we only met once <br>Even if we met twice on a night when I wasn’t that drunk <br>I still don’t recall what the fuck your name was, what it look like, bitch <br>Teacher calling out names in a homeroom class, hell nah <br>Hear my speakers straight bangin' and old school laugh <br>Think everybody lame like white boys tryna bring boat shoes back <br>Motherfuckers who carry guns, knowing damn well that they won’t shoot back <br>But you look cool though, just kidding no you don’t douchebag <br>But if I was cool as you I would go into a new car dealership and shoot up the showroom glass <br>Like a badass would <br>Scream like you want a bitch, scream like you have bad blood <br>Like a badass does <br>Take a picture with your gun, posted up, sayin' #thug <br>Go and tat that up <br>Yo, homie what’s the deal with this bond getting backpack love <br>Let my cash stack up like the checks so my ass cap her <br>When I smack all these whack rappers tryna be like me <br><br>Hook <br>Homie, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Talk about your money, what you’ve done and where you’re from <br>To me it don’t add up, you ain’t all that good <br>Homie, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Think you’re dope, I’m like Oh, that sucks <br>See your music and I go crack up, ol’ stupid motherfucker <br><br>Verse 2 <br>Hate to see your DM on my IG feed <br>Just 'cause I replied one time doesn’t mean that you’re my GP <br>Sendin' links to your song, but you’re biting Tech N9ne, copy ICP <br>You’re the opposite lame ass white boy dropping N bombs <br>Who the fuck are you, the white Chief Keef <br>Need to stop that shit ol’ white ass boy <br>I don’t give a fuck if you got Pit Bulls <br>Saying where you get your work done <br>I don’t want to talk tattoos <br>I’m distracted, staring at your knockoff shoes <br>What the fuck are those Chinese Jays <br>Saying one day you’re gonna find me signed with Strange <br>Hate to ruin your parade, but I got bad news <br>You ain’t never gonna make it, and it’s better that you face it <br>You ain’t never made dope songs <br>You gon’ feel dumb in the end, like the millions of Americans that said “Vote Trump” <br>Man, I still can’t believe he won <br>Fuck paper, he gon’ make it rain those bombs <br>I’m sick of politics like chicks postin' pics with the Snapchat filter of puppy dog ears and a rainbow tongue <br>Flower crown on your head, make your eyes look pretty, lookin' shitty with no make-up on <br>Really got some little titties, but you tricked us 'cause you had a bunch of padding in an A-cup bra <br>You the type to fall in love, tongue kissing after they suck off <br>A bus full of dudes after they fuck raw all night <br>They compare you to the same fuck boys, really they so punk <br><br>Hook <br>Homie, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Talk about your money, what you’ve done and where you’re from <br>To me it don’t add up, you ain’t all that good <br>Homie, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Think you’re dope, I’m like Oh, that sucks <br>See your music and I go crack up, ol’ stupid motherfucker <br><br>Verse 3 <br>I can’t listen to your shit no more, 'cause when I do I get so bored <br>When I feel it boomin', it hits so hard <br>Like when Lennox Lewis and Klitschko fought <br>Got a Famous hoody, some retro fours <br>Some expensive jewelry, a disco ball <br>On my trigger finger, a missile launch <br>'Bout to happen any second it’s an intro for verse three <br>Curse me and you’ll be verially assaulted <br>Fire's bitter, try me , end up burning and engulfed <br>In a ball of flames, hall of fame nominee <br>I should be twice as big, kill em like the villain in a SAW film <br>Home of the Braves and the Falcons and the Hearts fans <br>I’m as calm as croc in a swamp, man <br>Waiting in the water for my prey like I’m Jaws <br>Tryna to bait me and fall in, you gon' see a shark’s fin <br>Starvin' like I’m sleeping on a park bench <br>Spit bars, serving rappers like I bar tend <br>Star shit, you gon’ need an RN <br>Superman blending in like I’m Clark Kent <br>Fuck how big your bark is, you ain’t got the heart <br>Better sharpen your skills, I’m a killer, you a marked man <br>When it’s all said and done, you’ll be burned to a crisp <br>Smokin', I can smell the cartilage and charred skin <br>Set em on fire <br>Used to have it up high now look how low the bar bend <br>Look how many off brand rappers put they palm print on it <br>'Cause they shinin' for a moment <br>They got broke and then they're starved, damn <br>Selling dope in their apartment <br>Now we toast champagne, open up the caviar can <br>Blowing money in department stores <br>Got diamonds in my ring, got diamonds in my watch band <br><br>Hook <br>God Damn, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Talk about your money, what you’ve done and where you’re from <br>To me it don’t add up, you ain’t all that good <br>Homie, I’m a whole different breed <br>In a whole different league <br>Look at you and show disbelief 'cause I can see your ho tendencies <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Shut your ho ass up <br>Think you’re dope, I’m like Oh, that sucks <br>See your music and I go crack up, ol’ stupid motherfucker </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Last Call</td></tr><tr><th
