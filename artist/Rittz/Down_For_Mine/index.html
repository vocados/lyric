now, when I rap I gotta reputation <br>Causin' devastation, I get down for mine <br>See Tech N9ne fucked around and signed <br>An individual that's visibly out his mind <br>It's hard to count the times, how many rappers I've <br>Massacred, Al Capone, and every day is St Valentine's <br>It's Jonny Valiant, I'm the first thing that comes to mind <br>When you hit the Gwinnett County line <br>I'm on powder and Crown combined <br>I like to mix the uppers with the liquor then I switch up <br>Poppin' the Klonopins, I got me a prescription <br>Watch out for the rappers tryna plot another stick up <br>Reminisce the kids in my clique that ain't with us anymore <br>They ain't live to see past twenty <br>Tryna see fast money, got they ditch dug early <br>So no wonder why it's hard to be religious <br>White boy shit, we ain't hoppin' in a pickup <br>They depict us to be redneck <br>Let my bread stack till I'm in a Benz truck, limo tint <br>Gotta wipe a pimp down with a lint brush <br>Oh-ee, Louie <br>Symbol on my shoe, blew two Gs, too clean <br>Groupies turning up, they wanna fuck <br>And turn the bus into a nude scene, that's routine <br>Fuck the YouTube views and your news feed <br>'Cause your whole style is whack <br>You getting clowned nowadays when you sound exactly like another man <br>I ain't tryna vouch for that <br>Used to wear button downs and slacks but now you trap <br>You strapped but you swear that you down to clash <br>There's mumble rap in style, you be trying hard to sound relaxed <br>You take words and pronounce them bad <br>To sound like you have an accent, really that's it <br>I never thought I'd use the word flabbergasted <br>It's an exact fit to explain my reaction, like I'm yackin' in a trash bin <br>I don't use a bunch of ad-libs to distract fans <br>I combine the real with the metaphors and bars <br>From the wheel struggling to get a deal <br>Through the valley in the hills <br>Like you tryna win the Tour De France <br>You can't tell me I don't kill shit <br>Turn me up with the Coupe de Ville feel with a foreign car <br>Been ten years and I'm still lit <br>Now my Colorado homies, and it's twenty past four o'clock <br>It's last call but I got another quart to pop <br>And I ain't ever wore a cap and gown <br>But got mass amounts of cash to count <br>I'm rapping now for spazzing out <br>So tell 'em when they ask around <br><br>Hook <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, get down for mine <br>I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times <br>I show out and shine with no doubt in mind <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, get down for mine <br>I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times <br>I show out and shine with no doubt in mind <br>I get down <br><br>Verse 2 <br>That's truth that you can't dispute <br>It's CNT in this bitch, what a man'll do <br>Dick Tracy, attention to <br>I'd be the same ol' me if I wore tight pants and boots <br>Is that a diss Incorrect, get an 'X' like *buzzer* <br>Ain't no family feud, the seed planted bloomed <br>We hit Atlanta, flew to France and landed Coco Vance and broke madams and pampered dudes <br>Them ugly motherfuckers smiling for the camera crew <br>I'm getting bands of loot, the broke shit discussion <br>'Cause I finally got a check, we can stretch out money <br>Maybe you were meant to be a fitness instructor <br>Witness destruction when I represent for the misfits amongst us <br>The old heads, kids, and youngsters <br>Fuck with me you'll be stuck on me <br>Like you had unsafe sex with an ex of Usher's <br>Is you a bald bitch What you need a hairpiece Got the herpes <br>Sue me, I'ma throw you down the staircase <br>You try to tell me that I broke too many barricades <br>That's why you never hear my music on the airwaves <br>I drop a nuke on every record, that's an air raid <br>Pull your hair weave, bitch suck and bob <br>I need to find a chick kinda like Blac Chyna <br>To give me all the checks she collect from Rob <br>You never see 'em interview me on the The Breakfast Club <br>But they know me in New Zealand and Czech Repub <br>Up in Cleveland and Lincoln, Nebraska, Reno, Nevada <br>Alaska has extra love <br>Mic check like Tech, I'm a regular <br>You saw All Eyez on Me, thought you was 2Pac <br>But you a Little Richard homie wop-bop-a-loo-bop <br>You shocked that I blew up <br>I thought that you knew <br><br>Hook <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, get down for mine <br>I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times <br>I show out and shine with no doubt in mind <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, down for mine <br>I get down <br>Down for mine, get down for mine <br>I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times <br>I show out and shine with no doubt in mind <br>I get down </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Last
