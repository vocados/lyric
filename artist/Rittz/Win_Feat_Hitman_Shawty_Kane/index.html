box <br>Not the type of rapper you gon’ find inside a thrift shop <br>Running to the money like a pitboss whoa <br>Taking trips cross-country, My inbox full of titty pics, make a pit stop <br>You can see the lip prints on my dick from your lip gloss <br>Pimp shit, bitches always looking shy, tell ‘em get lost <br>My celebrity affectin’ me, somebody must have tipped off people where I live <br>See

racks, I’m 'bout to lift off <br>NASA, plasma TV 65 inch, class of 98’, skated out in 96’ <br>Glass of Crown Royal, splash of a lime <br>Whizz, Massive amounts of gas, used to have to buy mids <br>Used to have to fry fish, thinking how can I fit all this shit inside this <br>Dumpster without having to dive in, making $9 an hour <br>I barely had enough to buy cigs <br>And I ain’t trying to say that I’m rich, but I ain’t trippin' on no ‘Port package <br>Livin’ more lavish, New York status <br>Got the horseradish and the Au Jus on the side of my prime rib <br>I’m just proud of what I did <br>When people see you living better, they lots of Dry Gin <br>But I ain’t finna let 'em nestle under my skin <br>Game over, I win in the end 'cause <br><br>Hook: Rittz <br>So much time was spent <br>Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend <br>Situation made it hard to find my strength <br>To convince myself in the end one day <br>I'd finally win <br>I knew I'd finally win <br>And I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again <br>'Cause so much time was spent <br>Broke in the same boat with my friends <br>But when I blew there were <br>More then a few that would try to act cool <br>But I knew they hate to see me win <br>They hate to see you win <br>But I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again, and <br><br>Verse 2: Hitman Shawty <br>Feelin' Tom Brady in the Super Bowl <br>Ridin' in the ' Vette they gon' stay patrol <br>Rizz on that brown, don't lose control <br>All the work gone bring another load <br>Don't leave the state, out on parole <br>Safe full of money, kill me for the code <br>This a celebration , Laco make a toast <br>Everybody eatin', fuck who ate the most <br>Going coast to coast, shop at different states <br>Jet skis on the lake, feds try to build a case <br>Stab me in back, smile in your face <br>Laid back, windows tinted <br>Home run, ninth innin' <br>'member days with some pennies <br>They don't wanna see me winnin' <br><br>Hook: Rittz <br>So much time was spent <br>Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend <br>Situation made it hard to find my strength <br>To convince myself in the end one day <br>I'd finally win <br>I knew I'd

all <br>Slick boy , bitch, I was born to ball <br>Been kickin' up dust and stirrin' up fuss <br>Since a young nigga was about two feet tall <br>Been takin' trips back and fourth out the mall <br>Fuckin' up checks and servin' hard ball <br>Smoked the best green and shot at dope fiends <br>And hung with niggas who got lawyers on call <br>But now we gotta deal with the new wave <br>Some fake like Shaq wearin' Toupees <br>All the Instagram cap get you melee'd <br>Twelve addin' up shit like fifth grade <br>Some of the friends we grew up with <br>Ain't to be fucked with and crab any chance they get <br>Say that we'd kill for you but steal from you <br>Too old for that duck shit, quit <br>Actin' like you solid when you know you ain't <br>Ho runnin' through your vein like a blood bank <br>I mean the shit just pitiful, the hatin' gettin' critical <br>It rub off on a player like wet paint <br>Tell your partner that you comin' when you know you can't <br>Tell your homie you gonna help them when you know you ain't <br>Claimin' that it's all good but the shit fake <br>I can tell if you're a lame from a handshake <br>Ground floor, I'm getting money be the mandate <br>At the spot shit movin' like an earthquake <br>Fuck around get flipped, bitch, pancake <br>Do a 8, treat the shit like a mixtape <br>Say I'm strange but my clientele Norman Bates <br>Open 24/7 with the best rates
