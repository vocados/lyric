A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>Northside <br>A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>Northside <br>A town shit <br><br>Verse 1 <br>Northside Atlanta ambassador, back for more <br>The second I see 'em mash record <br>I’m spazzin' on 'em if they’re askin' for it <br>First to put it on the map, so don’t be actin like I passed the torch <br>Ain’t got the patience for the back and forth <br>The murder rap has got me on a wanted poster with a cash reward <br>I’m short tempered, these boys better be glad I’m on <br>When I was young, I would jack you for your pack of ‘ports <br>They know me at the local package store, they give me discounts <br>Thirty minutes out from Midtown, where we sip Crown Royal <br>Someone swole, they get drunk and run they big mouth <br>Then somebody punch 'em, they unconscious for the ten count <br>This rap game is similar to being back in school again 'cause <br>All my crew is in the building and the in-crowd <br>It’s cool to be lame nowadays, so excuse me if my attitude is <br>Who the fuck are you to say what’s in style <br>Red 'fro retro, Atlanta got the red look <br>I be turning heads everywhere you see me step foot <br>Check stub full of commas, told you I was next up <br>Rollin' through Gwinnet I hit up both and now we're thista <br>Made a play on Pleasant Hill rolling through Sonesta <br>Phone ringing, I don’t answer so they blow my text up <br>Going the speed limit, police are eager to arrest you <br>Plus I had a lot of drank, I’d probably fail the breath-a <br>Lyzer test, change it up, I’m back to rhyming I confess <br>I think I’m the best , besides a couple guys alive or dead <br>Running over rivals, tire tread <br>Their entire head busts just like a virus spreading virally and I infect <br>Non-believers, fighting like a fly inside my spider web <br>Tell them give me my respect, climbing up a flight of stairs <br>Finessin' rhyming since the first Vanilla Ice was said <br>Ain’t nobody try me yet, I just pray to God I said <br><br>Hook <br>Forgive them for their sins, my lord <br>They know not what they do <br>I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood <br>Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew <br>They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool <br>Fuck around and lose my cool <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>North side, A town shit <br><br>Verse 2 <br>What you know about being the only white boy <br>Deep in the hood, in the city, waiting for hours trying to do a song <br>You hit the stage, you could tell they wanna boo you off <br>Before you even get started you gotta prove 'em wrong <br>Or say fuck 'em, my chain tuck 'em, my jewelry on <br>Go head pull your gun, I hope you’re shooting to kill <br>The few screws that I have inside my head already loose <br>Go head shoot me, I’m suicidal, I’d do it myself <br>I might have got a record deal 'cause I rap good <br>But before you ever heard of me I earned my respect <br>I kept it cool with people, some were scared to come to my crib <br>Stories going around Gwinnett about the ones who got the gas <br>Wolf, by the cash door <br>Blaming me for what my boys did, Moreland oh nab bind over Jorlan, Homie Rj’s shortin' them for dollar bills <br>People pullin' pistols on me saying who this white boy is <br>And I ain’t saying this to try and be hard, but I ain’t fought no games <br>Don’t believe me had some boys act strange <br>They done toured with me, can be sure <br>That they knew if someone pissed me off, I’d swang 98 <br>Homie shot a lady and a baby, point blank range <br>And he set 'em on fire in the trunk of a car <br>My best friend in sixth grade killed a lady for nothing <br>Now he’s a manager at Denny’s, Servers call him the The Boss <br>The point I’m tryna get across is I got a heart <br>I don’t wanna harm anyone, but I’ma finish what they start <br>Got an emptiness and dark side in me 'cause I’m scarred <br>People start to think you’re soft, when you’re caught without your guard <br>Thinking you’re an entertainer and the odds are getting got <br>Talking shit ain’t gonna happen, get the addy where you are <br>Pull up on you with the crew pull your car <br>Fuck a fade, we’re gonna stomp you like we would a 9 to 5, pray to God <br><br>Hook <br>Forgive them for their sins, my lord <br>They know not what they do <br>I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood <br>Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew <br>They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool <br>Fuck around and lose my cool <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>A A A town shit <br>North side, A town shit </p><table class="table table-striped
