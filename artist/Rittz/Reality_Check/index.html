<br>If you ain’t in my circle I ain’t got no trust in you <br>You a lame, using slang I ain’t accustomed to <br>Saying what the fuck I do <br>Like when a lady wake up naked in the bed <br>Laying next to Dr Huxtable <br>What you uncomfortable Wonderful Smoke with one or pool <br>I hit a blunt with you then go and crush a box of Lunchable’s <br>A Smucker’s Uncrustables and a couple pack of Gusher’s <br>Bust a bag of Ruffles open, start a crackin' Dutches <br>Let the guts fall out, y’all can shut ya’ll mouth <br>But ya’ll can suck it out in public saying fuck all out <br>What that embarrass you <br>With no comparison or similarities with me <br>And who is in the mirror that you stare into That's you <br>I’m pimping bitches why you scaring them like man this dude <br>Experimenting with ‘em let ‘em share ‘em while the cameras shoot <br>They need a director’s chair, you’re repping the censored ,yeah <br>An ode to C-N-T is deep connected like checkered square <br>Giuseppes and Natty’s and I just bought me a fresher pair <br>My guess is you would step into some Sketcher’s I’d never wear <br>No sense of style, I went to Fifth’s and I was in and out <br>With stacks of cash so massive it could be a risk to count <br>My pockets fat ain’t been no slimming down <br>Only getting fatter like a bitch done had an infant child that sits around <br>And you could say that I’m harsh, say my flavor is posh <br>I say that you ain’t getting paper, no mas <br>You a hater and I think I know why <br>'Cause I be taking long vacations in locations where they say Aloha <br>And having luaus, a mansion with a pool house <br>With you down bass <br>Sleeping on couches that expand into a pull-out <br>Broke in Neiman Marcus seen him glancing at the shoe aisle <br>But you ain’t got no money, you just flex like you do <br>Your rap is questionable, in fact you’re destined to lose <br>You ever test me get me deadly that’s inevitable <br>You on a stretcher with a medical crew, rescuing you <br>'Cause I decked you I ain’t testing no new wresting move <br>Suplexing dude, you would look fresh with a blue vest on <br>Working at Walmart, did you check the dude’s restroom <br>Get the carts from the lot Get a carpenter job <br>Or lay some carpet Ever thought of giving Arby’s a shot <br>Just not rapping acting like your bars are hard when they’re not <br>Honest to God you couldn’t market the garbage you got <br><br>Hook <br>You say the shit that you’re about to regret Motherfucker <br>That’s why you never get one ounce of respect <br>You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit <br>I think it’s time to get your reality checked <br>Check one, two <br>Check one, two <br>One, Two <br><br>Verse 2 <br>They say I murder shit and I just say affirmative <br>I just write what I observe like I’m a journalist, I'm merciless <br>My purpose ain’t to further your encouragement of surfacing <br>I heard your shit, your verses need refurbishing <br>But let’s be honest we done thought we heard the worst but then a trend emerges with a surge, the words just reoccur again <br>Is that a her or him I work my pen so much it hurts my hand <br>Like when you fingering a bitch to make her squirt and can’t <br>Her meat curtains look like turkey skin, screaming lord have mercy like I witnessed bitches twerking at a church event <br>And I’ve done fucked in church before don’t judge me for it I’m sure the lord above forgave me, maybe understood the circumstance that I was in <br>I was in and out of consciousness <br>A constant itch to put a straw up in my nostril , hit the soft and sniffed <br>Confidence was lost I used to say I was incompetent, but now I’m balling hanging off the rim like David Robinson <br>Bought my bitch exotic whips, ain’t no S&amp;M <br>A lot of artists getting played, ain’t no record spin <br>A lot of trends are getting dated, like leopard print <br>For years I watched the game and waited, but sat the bench <br>You convinced about it like you could do what I got, signed a deal at thirty-two , but still doing you in the process <br>Maybe I made it look easy, admit it, there isn't a stake in it making it feasible, they should have taken a breather instead of believing the people they keeping around and they lie <br>But really I’m a good guy, and I just stood by <br>But this is getting silly, good try <br>It’s time to quit but you’re delusional as usual <br>So you just go and hate on me online , but I’ve been on the look out <br><br>Hook <br>You say the shit that you’re about to regret Motherfucker <br>That’s why you never get one ounce of respect <br>You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit <br>I think it’s time to get your reality checked <br>Check one, two <br>Check one, two <br>One, Two </p><table class="table
