in our own way to honor and celebrate your life <br><br>Verse 1 <br>When I first met you, it was back in '95 <br>When I used to battle other rappers at the football game <br>In the crowd you would always stand out <br>8th grader big as hell but you ain't' never look your age <br>In 9th grade you were killin seniors on the field <br>People talkin' bout the records that they watch you break <br>Popular as hell, everbody knew Charles <br>Bondin with you on the night we slap boxed and blazed <br>We was up in Breckeridge Crest we were just kids <br>Smokin blunts in front of your apartment place <br>You introduced me to my best friend who was your best friend <br>I remember when he called that day <br>You told me that they shot you in the back you was winnin in a fight <br>And ever since it ain't been quite the same <br>So much personality and talent why they had to take your life away <br>I'm screamin hold on <br><br>Hook <br>I'm screaming hold on <br>Here one day and the next they gone <br>But they way too young to have to tell 'em so long <br>So long <br>Have to tell 'em so long <br><br>Verse 2 <br>You was a new kid at school from New Jersey <br>Used to rock the Timbaland boots with the camo suit <br>Used to go inside of kids' pockets in the parking lot before school <br>They were scared of you <br>Me and you were cool <br>We had mutual friends bumpin' DJ Clue up in RJ's crib <br>You had a reputation for playing no games <br>Hitting licks and making people take off all they shit <br>As time went on, you became a good friend, let your guard down <br>We would smoke and talk 'bout rap <br>When Slick was in jail you would check up on me <br>Told me call you if I had a problem 'cause you got my back <br>When you was outta work selling herb, you would front me QP's <br>Chill and listen to the verse I dropped <br>Me and you was laughing saying it's ironic that my mama was your nurse when you first got shot <br>In your shoulder but you took it like a soldier <br>Had somebody watching over you for you to take a shotgun blast <br>We were growing older I was broke and always working <br>All the homies in the circle sort of lost contact <br>Until the person came into my job <br>I thought I overheard him saying that somebody murdered one armed black <br>I ain't believe it til my homie told me that you're gone and you won't come back <br><br>Hook <br>I'm screaming hold on <br>Here one day and the next they gone <br>But they way too young to have to tell 'em so long <br>So long <br>Have to tell 'em so long <br><br>Verse 3 <br>It's kinda hard for me to write <br>I been missing you from the day <br>That we moved back in Summer '88 <br>When we come to visit you, we always wanna stay <br>You would wake us up to a plate of scrambled eggs <br>You taught me how to cook, taught us how to fish <br>You and Dave hoping that the Steelers win the game <br>We would all laugh <br>We knew when they screwed up a play <br>Cause you would start yelling at the screen <br>Taught me to enjoy simple things <br>It would mean the world <br>Sitting on the porch with you when you feed the squirrels <br>Whistle with the birds <br>Full from the meal that you made us <br>Chill, watch Vanna on the Wheel <br>Come and spend Christmas with you every year <br>Summers too when I'm home wishing I was there <br>Next to you and Ma-maw sitting in your chair <br>I could never fit into the slippers that you wear <br>Tell a joke here and there <br>You ain't really say much, giving your opinion or a comment <br>You drove a tank in the second World War <br>Was in combat, you ain't ever brag about your time in <br>You had open heart surgery when you were in your sixties <br>Never thought you would see ninety <br>As I was going through phases, you would never judge us <br>All you did was love us, blindly when finally <br>I had a day off right before a show in Pittsburgh <br>I was hoping I would spend it with you <br>The rest of the family come and visit you a lot last five years <br>I don't really get to <br>Mom said you were really sick too <br>Had a big bruise on you 'cause you fell in the shower <br>And now when you wanna talk about all the plans <br>What Ma-maw s'posed to do without you <br>Having trouble getting in and out your chair <br>Noddin' out in the middle of a sentence while you're talking <br>I can tell that your frail and you fought death off for so long <br>Now you finally feel exhausted <br>Time to go, I don't really wanna leave <br>Said I love you Pat like it's gonna be my last <br>Five days later, I was told that you passed <br>And you finally let go when you grasped <br><br>Hook <br>Hold on <br>Here one day and the next they gone <br>But they way too young to have to tell 'em so long <br>So long <br>Have to tell 'em so long
