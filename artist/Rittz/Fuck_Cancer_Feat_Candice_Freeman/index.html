Candice Freeman)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Rittz<br><br> My wife's best friend Wendy, always been the life of the party <br>She come to chill with my girl at our crib <br>All three of us drinking from the night to the morning <br>Her personality is one of a kind, so funny <br>Make you laugh til you cry from a story <br>I haven't seen her in a while then my wife came downstairs <br>Crying saying Wendy just called me <br>Told me that she thought she had something wrong with her <br>For a long time, finally went and saw a doctor <br>They did an ultrasound, found cancer in her thyroid <br>That was rare and uncommon <br>Started crying harder, I was try'na calm her <br>She's the last person that I thought would ever get sick <br>She's a mom to Sebastian, Mia, and Karma <br>Hard enough alone, even worse with three kids <br>Lost a nine to five and the house where she lived <br>All her belongings that she used to own are gone <br>Stunting when her mom wanna move into her home <br>Now they gotta go remove a tumor from her throat <br>Let you know that what you're going through could be worse <br>Such a strong person, I could never be her <br>Hoping all the chemo and the surgeries work <br>The redness on her neck is from the third degree burns <br>Hurting try'na turn her head, losing weight, losing hair <br>Hard to understand and can't swallow, can't talk <br>Can't drink water, nurse told her just nod <br>Choking on the burnt skin, got her coughing up blood <br>Got a feeding tube feeding through her stomach <br>Cause she doesn't wanna miss <br>Ain't working 'cause the chemo got her sick <br>She could catch a virus, easy on the treatment <br>And now they say she's not allowed to be around her kids <br>Gotta smoke a cigarette saying she don't wanna live <br>But she'd not come to grips with it coming to an end <br>She ain't understand at the time <br>That she had the will inside to survive, dying wasn't in the plan <br>And she talk about her family and her friends <br>And her kids, what she been through <br>For them, she would do it all again <br>And happy to survive when there's some that never did <br>I'm just happy that she's in the situation that she's in <br>She's alive <br><br>Hook: Rittz <br>They said my time was ticking, I was blown away <br>Tomorrow isn't promised, I can go today <br>They told me I was sick inside but I'm okay <br>Cause when I beat it and survive then I'ma say <br>Fuck cancer <br>If I go to bed and die before I wake <br>I'ma beg and pray the lord my soul to take <br>'Cause I ain't rolling over, I got total faith <br>I'ma win the battle, when I do then I'ma say <br>Fuck cancer <br><br>Verse 2 <br>One of my best friends in the whole world felt a lump in his armpit <br>It was fine so he thought it was a bruise <br>When he saw it getting hard, it had started to alarm him <br>Try'd to put it off for as long as he could <br>But he knew pretty soon that he's gotta see a doctor <br>When he did, they just said it was an ingrown hair <br>Don't be scared, 'cause it's probably not a problem <br>But he still wanted a second opinion so they sent him <br>To a place they recommended so that he could see a specialist <br>When they started to examine it, they said <br>I hate to say it, I'm afraid that the lump is something cancerous <br>Set him up for surgery <br>They removed the lump, he was try'na not to sweat it <br>Wondering what the result says <br>Waited three long days til he finally got to talk to the doctor <br>He told him he had Hodgkin's, therapeutic cancer <br>That's a lot to process <br>Funny to be always thinking anybody not him <br>He the type of guy that light a room up when he walk in <br>He decided nah, he's a newly wedded husband <br>Thought of all the moments in his past, all the time spent <br>Doing drugs, chasing money, suddenly was nonsense <br>Told the lord above him he was done with that, I promise <br>Dying ain't an option, there's too much to accomplish <br>It's from a caught him far from Puerto Rico <br>Staying out the chemicals aside of from the chemo <br>His wife was like his rock, when he miss her, wanna lean on her <br>When he's shitting motivating him to keep going <br>Didn't want no only told so many people <br>Even shot a documentary when he was history <br>A reason people in the same position <br>Maybe gets him out remission <br>And it's possible to beat it and achieve gold <br>He's determined he gon' live to see another year <br>Turned his fear into anger <br>The anger that's inside of him provided him with strength <br>Now his vision's clear <br>Even when they told him he was sick, he never shed a tear <br>Til the day they called him up and told him he was cancer-free <br>You could see his mom up in heaven smiling now <br>Barely recognize him cause he lost a hundred pounds <br>Muscle round, running miles, went and turned his life around <br>He's alive <br><br>Hook <br>They said my time was ticking, I was blown away <br>Tomorrow isn't promised, I can go today <br>They told me I was sick inside but I'm okay <br>Cause when I beat it, I'll survive and I'ma say <br>Fuck cancer <br>If I go to bed before I die before I wake <br>I'ma beg and pray the lord my soul to take <br>'Cause I ain't rolling over, I can total fate <br>I'ma win the battle, when I do then I'ma say <br>Fuck cancer </p><table class="table
