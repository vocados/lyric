class="cover-heading">Middle Of Nowhere</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Rittz<br><br> Rittz up in this bitch again <br>Those who listen, witnessin' <br>Uncut dope, I lift a pen <br>And those who diss get disciplined <br>My imprint is infinite <br>Getting tense and intimate <br>When I'm pissed shit hits the fan <br>Who's ready for Rittz <br><br>Verse 1 <br>This rap game's so mundane, I just play dumb <br>Trying to listen to songs playing, then what main come <br>Making fun of them, none of them ever was A1 <br>Trying to fight like they John Wayne, well I'm James Bond <br>In my blood-stained tux, people that played me they thinking they got away with it <br>I'm taking out my frustration <br>Finally shedded the dead weight, settled the debt, paid <br>We done shoveled the red clay, we dug graves up <br>Got a couple of homies that done me some favors <br>And show they appreciation, they told me that they would bust they guns <br>But instead of it I debted it and just gave love <br>I’ve been heavily indebt and I done took pay cuts <br>Might have been a lot to me, to them it was just cake crumbs <br>I’ve done been around a minute, but I just came up <br>Hungry for dinner, but shit, I just ate lunch <br>At the Optimus, tapas, scallops and crustaceans <br>Tuna tartare, the way to act above all, like wah lah <br>I’m sipping crown and soda, but I would rather have the monarch <br>Thinking bout how far came when I’m out on tour <br>4 AM I’m in the bed, I’m drunk and I’m staring at the wall art <br>I fought off the competition like I was a war lord <br>I swore I should have blew in 2002, but given a minute <br>I would hit a higher altitude, then I surprised you from out the blue <br><br>Hook <br>From the middle of nowhere <br>People wonder how I blew, where I come from <br>The middle of nowhere <br>I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in <br>The middle of nowhere <br>You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from <br>The middle of nowhere <br>It might be lights out for you, you get found in <br>The middle of nowhere <br><br>Verse 2 <br>This your first time hearing me, then you should go backwards <br>Listen to Top of the Line and study the craftwork <br>Then check out Next to Nothing, that was me expressing what I thought it was and what it wasn’t by becoming a rapper <br>After that then play the Life and Times of Johnny Valiant <br>Listen to My Interview and study my answers <br>Then check out White Jesus, that was me, yeah <br>In the studio after working a double and my back hurt <br>Staining my apron, pouring buckets in the grease trap <br>Thinking that I need to try and take a GED class <br>Thirty and hurting for money, feeling like a sleaze bag <br>Feelings that I had are reoccurring when I re-cap <br>People biting me up in my lane without a Peach Pass <br>I ain’t gonna touch on that <br>I put on debt, but look I’m next, I took my steps, I stood out <br>I’m feeling like there ain’t no one I can’t out-rap <br>But since I made it people wonder why I look all mad <br>Because I’ve been trying to ride away, I'm in a boat without a paddle <br>Start to notice shit as I was growing as an adult <br>It’s hard for me to sugarcoat it like a bowl of Kellogg’s <br>They love you for a minute, but they’re quick to say you fell off <br>But I’ve been getting bigger and bigger and bigger <br>Mistaking me from the beginning, they still be getting overshadowed <br>The fans love me and they gonna travel to the <br><br>Hook <br>The middle of nowhere <br>People wonder how I blew, where I come from <br>The middle of nowhere <br>I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in <br>The middle of nowhere <br>You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from <br>The middle of nowhere <br>It might be lights out for you, you get found in <br>The middle of nowhere <br><br>Verse 3 <br>Want bars or want me to chop <br>I’mma do both then, I’m like a piranha inside a bowl of goldfish <br>It’s hard for you to smell me like your nose is clothes pinned <br>I went and did a show in Minnesota, Bone Twins <br>No shit, so lit, no rapper’s my match <br>With white trash getting money acting high class <br>High stacks, it’s hard to fold the bills <br>Pockets fat as Jonah Hill before and after the gastric bypass <br>Chugging the Zinfandel, then I smash the wine glass <br>Picture my dick, the bitches had to bat they eyelash <br>A maximum line slash from Dimebag Daryll, long hair and don’t care I wanna catch the dime-bag <br>You at the iMAX Theatre ‘bout to see me in 3D <br>Listening like they had me wiretapped <br>Paid cash for fast cars, you had to finance <br>Scientist inside of my lab <br><br>Hook <br>In the middle of nowhere <br>People wonder how I blew, where I come from <br>The middle of nowhere <br>I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in <br>The middle of nowhere <br>You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from <br>The middle of
