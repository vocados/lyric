Brother Ali<br><br> Okay so it might appear <br>To an outsider that you found your way up out of here <br>They're saying you died of suicide <br>That's the last thing I want to hear <br>They tell me that it's hardly fair to blame myself <br>What a hell of a cross to bare <br>You didn't say it in your letter <br>But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear <br>Found out the amount of fear <br>You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror <br>And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare <br>I left you playing solitaire, and I promise you that I'm sincere <br>If you're looking for some judgment, you won't find it here <br>Let's be honest here <br>I can't say I've never known that kind of despair <br>When the clouds appear, how's life fair <br>I just want to draw you near <br>Not to make it about me, but how could you check out <br>Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear <br>I think I would've listened <br>Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it <br>You sang your swan song, we all dismissed it <br>Because you filled the room with laughter <br>I watched when you thought no one was looking at you <br>In hind sight, I wonder where your smile went <br>When the party ended and you swallowed it <br>I saw you swallow it <br><br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>How many cries soak through your disguise <br>Before you drown in your silent tears <br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>How many times can you fight for your life <br>Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer <br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>How many cries soak through your disguise <br>Before you drown in your silent tears <br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>How many times can you fight for your life <br>Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer <br><br>I've had car accidents <br>Where everything is slow motion no matter how fast it's happening <br>Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling <br>But can't always react to it <br>Your whole life might flash before your eyes <br>The minute when you transition to the other side <br>But what can actually happen in that time <br>In between the leaping and the moment you collide <br>In between the trigger and the blast <br>In between you let go of the wheel and you crash <br>In between the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle <br>Turn out the lights, roll the dice on tomorrow <br>Is there a moment to reflect, can there be regret <br>Is there a wait not yet, let me reset <br>Or is it just too painful to accept <br>That maybe death just seemed best <br><br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>If you not winning, you can go down swinging <br>Even if it doesn't feel like they're fighting fair <br>Okay so it might appear <br>That you took yourself up out of here <br>I'm trying not to resent you <br>But you left me defenseless in the life we share <br><br>Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands <br>How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan <br>When nobody who grows old stands a chance <br>What about this mysterious dance <br>Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance <br>But these are questions I can only ask <br>The person looking back in the looking glass </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>All The Beauty In This Whole Life</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-05-05</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rap / Hip-hop</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
