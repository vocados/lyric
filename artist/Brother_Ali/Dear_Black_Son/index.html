Brother Ali<br><br> Dear Black Son, there's people you've never met <br>Who fear and hate you for something that you never did <br>And these people are so self convinced <br>Sometimes they pull the trigger, call that self defense <br>And in that sad insanity <br>Their fear is realer to them than your humanity <br>But that's their problem, it's not yours <br>Listen to your pop for a second <br>These are the confessions of a father broken hearted <br>Who don't know how to pull his only son out of a target <br>They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started <br>You were a king long before them ships departed <br>You are not defined by anybody else's crimes <br>You don't need to answer for what happens in their minds <br>You are not confined by their imaginary lines <br>You don't need permission to exist with the divine <br>In fact, you don't need permission from no one including me <br>You need not do anything but be, just breathe <br>Whatever you dream let it mean you're free <br>Tears on your cheek never made nobody weak <br>Sometimes we got to grieve let it burn, let it bleed <br>Then let yourself heal, pray to God that it will <br>You've got a spirit that a bullet can't kill <br>That doesn't make it any less real <br><br>They say it takes a man to raise a man <br>You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand <br>And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass <br>Maybe see how long I can make an hour last <br>Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand <br>And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass <br>Maybe see how long I can make an hour last <br>Dear Black Son <br><br>Dear Black Son, I can't protect you like I want to <br>I never judge you, all I can do is love you <br>And that's all anyone can ever do is love you <br>All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you <br>They recognize divine you <br>So they try to find themselves by defining you <br>They're living in a myth that they don't want to lose <br>And now they're too terrified to face your kind of truth <br>But every single time you shine it's proof that they might've threw a chain around your body, never conquered you <br>They don't always honor you but they love your culture <br>Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you <br>It's best to keep your hands where they can see them <br>And try to understand that you're not even what they're peeping <br>They don't see a sweet kid that loves his little sister <br>Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures <br>In fact, they don't visualize a kid <br>They see grown man imagery, mythic masculinity <br>But you are not their fetishes or fears <br>Nor my ambition and tears, nothing can interfere <br>We've got to trust our seeds once we sow them <br>We hold them when they're growing <br>But we never really own them <br>We love up on them, play with 'em, pray for them <br>And cling very closely to them moments <br><br>They say it takes a man to raise a man <br>You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand <br>And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass <br>Maybe see how long I can make an hour last <br>Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand <br>And her I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass <br>Maybe see how long I can make an hour last <br><br>Dear black son </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>All The Beauty In This Whole Life</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-05-05</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rap / Hip-hop</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
