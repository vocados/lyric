until the end of time</br>We were more than friends, before the story ends</br>And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design</br>Our love had been so strong for far too long</br>I was weak with fear that something would go wrong</br>Before the possibilities came true</br>I took all possibility from you</br>Almost laughed myself to tears</br>Ha hahahahaha</br>Conjuring her deepest fears</br>Come here you fucking bitch</br>Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times</br>I can't believe it</br>Ripped her heart out right before her eyes</br>Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it</br>She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping</br>Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in</br>It goes on and on and on</br>I can keep you looking young and preserved forever</br>With a fountain spray on your youth whenever</br>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime</br>Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs</br>And I know, I know it's not your time</br>But bye, bye</br>And a word to the wise when the fire dies</br>You think it's over but it's just begun</br>But baby don't cry</br>You had my heart, at least for the most part</br>'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime</br>We fell apart, let's make a new start</br>'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah</br>But baby don't cry</br>Now possibilities I'd never considered</br>Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard</br>Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave</br>To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved</br>Smiling right from ear to ear</br>Almost laughed herself to tears</br>Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times</br>I can't believe it</br>Ripped his heart out right before his eyes</br>Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it</br>Eat the shit out of it</br>Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways</br>I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave</br>I gotta make up for what I've done</br>'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven</br>While you burned in hell, no peace forever</br>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime</br>Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs</br>And I know, I know it's not your time</br>But bye, bye</br>And a word to the wise when the fire dies</br>You think it's over but it's just begun</br>But baby don't cry</br>You had my heart, at least for the most part</br>'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime</br>We fell apart, let's make a new start</br>'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah</br>But baby don't cry</br>Maniacal laughter</br>I will suffer for so long</br>What will you do, not long enough</br>To make it up to you</br>I pray to God that you do</br>I'll do whatever you want me to do</br>Well then I'll grant you one chance</br>And if it's not enough</br>If it's not enough, If it's not enough</br>If it's not enough</br>Not enough</br>Try again</br>Try again</br>And again</br>And again</br>Over and over again</br>We're coming back, coming back</br>We'll live forever, live forever</br>Let's have wedding, have a wedding</br>Let's start the killing, start the killing</br>You fucking bitch</br>Maniacal laughter</br>Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life</br>Yes, I do</br>Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life</br>I do</br>I now pronounce you</br>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime</br>Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs</br>And I know, I know it's not your time</br>But bye,
