his voice, know he felt scared</br>Government won't give him assistance</br>I asked him how he doing, he said welfare, it's no help there</br>I got more problems, I ain't in Bel Air</br>Worrying about how my uncle feel without his health care</br>Is wealth near Nigga please</br>Ten years later and they saying where the team</br>I love AChal but I miss P</br>I miss Saint, Kwass, I miss Steve</br>I miss Nak yelling out GFC</br>I miss Keet, Mickey, this is me</br>Couple days we disagreed and I'd be so distraught</br>But sometimes when you grow up, you grow apart</br>Ay, my open heart show the mark</br>Just wanna say sorry from now going forth</br>The rap game's a garage so when the motor start</br>Get your spot in front, don't worry where Rosa parks</br>'05 in The Bronx, blunt roll and spark</br>Spice weed, smoked peppered pot, think of Tony Starks</br>Cold turkey gettin' money, I don't try the drugs</br>Resemblin' Kelly Bundy, I ain't like the Bud</br>Now I'm 34 and got a wife to love</br>And kids to feed when we decide on Mini Me's</br>I live and breathe for my children's needs</br>Planting seeds before they're here for bigger trees</br>Lord help me as I hit my knees</br>I don't wanna gain the world just to get fricasee'd</br>Inception, I'm tryna live my dreams</br>Watching the totem spin while I'm in my sleep</br>Basement plumbin', shit is deep</br>I finally achieved this is me</br>It's like, it's like cruise control</br>And it's like, it's like stop and go</br>It's like, it's like climbing a ladder</br>But that ladder's on the side of a mountain</br>It's like, it's like sacrifice</br>And it's like, it's like cold as ice</br>It's like, it's like grabbing a moment</br>And it's like, it's like yours if you want it</br>Never thought this day would come to fruition</br>I do this for my achievers who kept wishing</br>Forever listened, remember Freshmen '09</br>Remember me quitting Back in 2013, damn</br>Remember Bishop That was Kings of the Bronx</br>Or that Honda ignition I shot a commercial man</br>I was 106'ing, remember Supras</br>Remembers before the cabs, I said Uber</br>Remember rockin' and rollin' I started the song off with saying Guggen Heim</br>Soundtrack for 2016, we in the future</br>Remember me on YouTube telling the story 'bout</br>Joe Budden while looking stupid, brother I'm human</br>How bout MauSe though, y'all know the sickest quote</br>Challenge yourself to defeat yourself, that shit was dope</br>Remember that show in New York, shorty was strippin' clothes</br>I had flour on the stage, I wasn't sniffin' coke</br>Here goes some flavour for your Kool Aid pack</br>I'm like y'all, still waiting on that Lupe track</br>Where it's at The top of my head I dunno</br>It's like Trump not knowing where his toupee at</br>Remember Drake on Overdose with that new age crack</br>Or when I did that Y mixtape in two days flat</br>Remember Trinity Remember 414 Remember skinny jeans</br>Remember that Warhol theme</br>BET cypher with Busta Rhymes, remember Freaky Will</br>I did an indiegogo, that video was ill</br>I love every supporter, when I was in the desert of pain</br>Y'all was the water pushing me outta the corner</br>Thought that I was a goner, I was miserable</br>But I climbed outta the rubble, this is my gift to you</br>I made it for the believers</br>Truly yours, the super senior</br>The achievers</br>It's like, it's like cruise control</br>And it's like, it's like stop and go</br>It's like, it's like climbing a ladder</br>But that ladder's on the side of a mountain</br>It's like, it's like sacrifice</br>It's like, it's like cold as ice</br>It's like, it's like grabbing a moment</br>And it's like, it's like yours if you want it</br>MauSe landed in Hong Kong in '89</br>Reagan still alive but George Bush is the main guy</br>Heard back at home they started cleaning the train sides</br>Already depressed 5 minutes off the plane ride</br>I'm commissioned to do a visual sculpture</br>Of a literal vulture, in the middle of boulders</br>To signify Britain and how it's really controlling</br>I wanna add a dragon, is that a silly component</br>Still mourning Jean and Andy, true disbelief</br>Perfecting the way that I move, I'm through spilling ink</br>Paint everywhere, I'm mixing the blue with the pink</br>Cocaine nights affecting my mood when I think</br>It's the the turn of the decade</br>Watching the ball drop, spray painting ducking the mall cops Working on Wednesdays</br>Heard one of my cousins just got murdered for MJ's</br>Cried in the front seat of my convertible MK</br>My mama told me art would be the death of me</br>That's when I told her death would be the best for me</br>I'd sell more if I died unexpectedly</br>You get appreciated more when you forever leave</br>What a recipe</br>I wonder if Basquiat felt the same way before he was a mainstay</br>Black and white paint, mixed together for a shade grey</br>On a canvas blocking whatever the sun ray made</br>MauSe Coulda died from alcohol</br>Or taking pictures of women without the condom on</br>I grew a beard it's the young black Salvador</br>Listening to Al B Sure, wondering if I'll be sure</br>That'll wake up from dreams that I never had</br>I usually stay up and grieve cause I never laugh</br>I remember Warhol told me i should never laugh</br>Or was it be never mad</br>I dunno<h2
