</script><br> My cousin came home from doing twelve years <br>And I could tell through his voice, know he felt scared <br>Government won't give him assistance <br>I asked him how he doing, he said welfare, it's no help there <br>I got more problems, I ain't in Bel Air <br>Worrying about how my uncle feel without his health care <br>Is wealth near Nigga please <br>Ten years later and they saying where the team <br>I love AChal but I miss P <br>I miss Saint, Kwass, I miss Steve <br>I miss Nak yelling out GFC <br>I miss Keet, Mickey, this is me <br>Couple days we disagreed and I'd be so distraught <br>But sometimes when you grow up, you grow apart <br>Ay, my open heart show the mark <br>Just wanna say sorry from now going forth <br>The rap game's a garage so when the motor start <br>Get your spot in front, don't worry where Rosa parks <br>'05 in The Bronx, blunt roll and spark <br>Spice weed, smoked peppered pot, think of Tony Starks <br>Cold turkey gettin' money, I don't try the drugs <br>Resemblin' Kelly Bundy, I ain't like the Bud <br>Now I'm 34 and got a wife to love <br>And kids to feed when we decide on Mini Me's <br>I live and breathe for my children's needs <br>Planting seeds before they're here for bigger trees <br>Lord help me as I hit my knees <br>I don't wanna gain the world just to get fricasee'd <br>Inception, I'm tryna live my dreams <br>Watching the totem spin while I'm in my sleep <br>Basement plumbin', shit is deep <br>I finally achieved this is me <br><br>It's like, it's like cruise control <br>And it's like, it's like stop and go <br>It's like, it's like climbing a ladder <br>But that ladder's on the side of a mountain <br>It's like, it's like sacrifice <br>And it's like, it's like cold as ice <br>It's like, it's like grabbing a moment <br>And it's like, it's like yours if you want it <br><br>Never thought this day would come to fruition <br>I do this for my achievers who kept wishing <br>Forever listened, remember Freshmen '09 <br>Remember me quitting Back in 2013, damn <br>Remember Bishop That was Kings of the Bronx <br>Or that Honda ignition I shot a commercial man <br>I was 106'ing, remember Supras <br>Remembers before the cabs, I said Uber <br>Remember rockin' and rollin' I started the song off with saying Guggen Heim <br>Soundtrack for 2016, we in the future <br>Remember me on YouTube telling the story 'bout <br>Joe Budden while looking stupid, brother I'm human <br>How bout MauSe though, y'all know the sickest quote <br>Challenge yourself to defeat yourself, that shit was dope <br>Remember that show in New York, shorty was strippin' clothes <br>I had flour on the stage, I wasn't sniffin' coke <br>Here goes some flavour for your Kool Aid pack <br>I'm like y'all, still waiting on that Lupe track <br>Where it's at The top of my head I dunno <br>It's like Trump not knowing where his toupee at <br>Remember Drake on Overdose with that new age crack <br>Or when I did that Y mixtape in two days flat <br>Remember Trinity Remember 414 Remember skinny jeans <br>Remember that Warhol theme <br>BET cypher with Busta Rhymes, remember Freaky Will <br>I did an indiegogo, that video was ill <br>I love every supporter, when I was in the desert of pain <br>Y'all was the water pushing me outta the corner <br>Thought that I was a goner, I was miserable <br>But I climbed outta the rubble, this is my gift to you <br>I made it for the believers <br>Truly yours, the super senior <br>The achievers <br><br>It's like, it's like cruise control <br>And it's like, it's like stop and go <br>It's like, it's like climbing a ladder <br>But that ladder's on the side of a mountain <br>It's like, it's like sacrifice <br>It's like, it's like cold as ice <br>It's like, it's like grabbing a moment <br>And it's like, it's like yours if you want it <br><br>MauSe landed in Hong Kong in '89 <br>Reagan still alive but George Bush is the main guy <br>Heard back at home they started cleaning the train sides <br>Already depressed 5 minutes off the plane ride <br>I'm commissioned to do a visual sculpture <br>Of a literal vulture, in the middle of boulders <br>To signify Britain and how it's really controlling <br>I wanna add a dragon, is that a silly component <br>Still mourning Jean and Andy, true disbelief <br>Perfecting the way that I move, I'm through spilling ink <br>Paint everywhere, I'm mixing the blue with the pink <br>Cocaine nights affecting my mood when I think <br>It's the the turn of the decade <br>Watching the ball drop, spray painting ducking the mall cops Working on Wednesdays <br>Heard one of my cousins just got murdered for MJ's <br>Cried in the front seat of my convertible MK <br>My mama told me art would be the death of me <br>That's when I told her death would be the best for me <br>I'd sell more if I died unexpectedly <br>You get appreciated more when you forever leave <br>What a recipe <br>I wonder if Basquiat felt the same way before he was a mainstay <br>Black and white paint, mixed together for a shade grey <br>On a canvas blocking whatever the sun ray made <br>MauSe Coulda died from alcohol <br>Or taking pictures of women without the condom on <br>I grew a beard it's the young black Salvador <br>Listening to Al B Sure, wondering if I'll be sure <br>That'll wake up from dreams that I never had <br>I usually stay up and grieve cause I never laugh <br>I remember Warhol told me i should never laugh <br>Or was it be never mad <br>I dunno </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The
