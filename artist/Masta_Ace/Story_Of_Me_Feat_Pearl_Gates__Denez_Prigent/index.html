thought that my rap lines would expand the earth</br>But they did, went to every corner of the globe</br>It's time to reveal, since y'all really wanna probe</br>I went from Brownsville kid, gone to King's County</br>To Queenstown, sitting in a sauna in a robe</br>And since then, never took a day off from the pen</br>I understood hard work would pay off in the end</br>Yeah for as long as my body is strong</br>I'mma give it all I got, try to body a song</br>I'mma give it all I got, try to rip that show</br>And yo, understand I got to get that doe</br>And so, cause I know how to spit that flow</br>Sold out three nights in a row, like Tic Tac Toe</br>In the fast lane, kick back slow, no need to rush</br>We royalty, bow down at the feet of us</br>The anticipation, it's like standing on the corner in the cold and you can see the bus</br>It's finally here, our arrival</br>Raised in the ghetto, singing songs called survival</br>We stand, united by the beat man</br>Tight plan, right hand on the Bible</br>Try to let you know</br>Just want to let you see</br>The real is all I know</br>Real is what I be</br>Time is now for y'all</br>Now is now for me</br>Life is beautiful</br>This the story of me</br>Just try to make history</br>Gotta make history</br>Ain't no mystery</br>Gotta make history</br>Know my history</br>Gotta make history</br>Can't shake destiny</br>Just gotta make history</br>Yeah, yeah, yeah</br>I almost had the nineties by the throat</br>I was just that close to getting money by the boatload</br>Instead of hoping what I wrote flowed</br>I could have said Whoop, there it is</br>But it would have felt so wrong to do that song</br>Try to prove I belong in a crew that strong</br>Listen, understand, this is preordain</br>This is written by God then we all came</br>Could have signed with Def Jam but Lyor changed</br>Changed his mind at the strangest time</br>He was still destined to sign a dangerous mind</br>Another cat with the grind the same as mine</br>Another son born on the fourth would come</br>He was ofcourse the one with that course to run</br>And like a ham sandwich on the softest bun</br>I refuse to eat it, I will not be defeated</br>Here to stay and get a lot completed</br>This what I got to offer, what I got is needed</br>Confident but I'm not conceited</br>And I swear, the same mistakes I made will not be repeated</br>I choose to keep paying up dues</br>Life try to beat me up like scuffed shoes</br>It was hard, doctor called me off guard</br>Same place I was born, got the rough news</br>We rise, we fall and pray for better days</br>Why shoot we for the stars and prayed for better aim</br>The world, the pain remained, it never change</br>Long as the sun will show, the cold is still the same</br>Just try to make history</br>Gotta make history</br>Ain't no mystery</br>Gotta make history</br>Know my history</br>Gotta make history</br>Can't shake destiny</br>Just gotta make history</br>Yeah, yeah, yeah</br>We rise, we fall and pray for better days</br>Why shoot we for the stars and prayed for better aim</br>The world, the pain remained, it never change</br>Long as the sun will show, the cold is still the same</br>Just try to make history</br>Gotta make history</br>Ain't no mystery</br>Gotta make history</br>Know my history</br>Gotta make history</br>Can't shake destiny</br>Just gotta make history</br>Yeah, yeah, yeah</br>The story of me, never would have knew me without it</br>And they won't make a movie about it</br>I mean, I guess they could but truely I doubt it</br>Mad friends watching Ralph McDaniels, knew me and shout it</br>Oh snap, that's Duval, he live in my building</br>Life in the PJ's, living and building</br>Whether you in Seflo or living in Tilden</br>Trying to escape men, women and children</br>A product of the same and when I got into the game</br>Initially my moms was really shocked and ashamed</br>She was like Boy you got a Bachelor's</br>And I was like Why they call it a bs</br>Bullshit walks as far is what I was taught</br>Yet I ain't had one job interview and she stressed</br>The story of me, born from the story of us</br>Studio bound, the story of us</br>My Honda's in the shop, no warranty</br>I need a new regulator, no Warren G</br>But I'mma get by, do or die</br>And then I left URI</br>I looked around and then came the yellow tape</br>I decided to sit on chrome and accelerate</br>And after that, I knew they wanted me gone and singing a swan song but I decided to let 'em wait<h2
