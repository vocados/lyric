Pearl Gates & Denez Prigent)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Masta Ace<br><br> Still here <br>Some how <br><br>Man, it took me 15 years to understand my worth <br>It was 1988 when Marley planned my birth <br>Had to get my feet up out of the sand and surf <br>Never thought that my rap lines would expand the earth <br>But they did, went to every corner of the globe <br>It's time to reveal, since y'all really wanna probe <br>I went from Brownsville kid, gone to King's County <br>To Queenstown, sitting in a sauna in a robe <br>And since then, never took a day off from the pen <br>I understood hard work would pay off in the end <br>Yeah for as long as my body is strong <br>I'mma give it all I got, try to body a song <br>I'mma give it all I got, try to rip that show <br>And yo, understand I got to get that doe <br>And so, cause I know how to spit that flow <br>Sold out three nights in a row, like Tic Tac Toe <br>In the fast lane, kick back slow, no need to rush <br>We royalty, bow down at the feet of us <br>The anticipation, it's like standing on the corner in the cold and you can see the bus <br>It's finally here, our arrival <br>Raised in the ghetto, singing songs called survival <br>We stand, united by the beat man <br>Tight plan, right hand on the Bible <br><br>Try to let you know <br>Just want to let you see <br>The real is all I know <br>Real is what I be <br>Time is now for y'all <br>Now is now for me <br>Life is beautiful <br>This the story of me <br>Just try to make history <br>Gotta make history <br>Ain't no mystery <br>Gotta make history <br>Know my history <br>Gotta make history <br>Can't shake destiny <br>Just gotta make history <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah <br><br>I almost had the nineties by the throat <br>I was just that close to getting money by the boatload <br>Instead of hoping what I wrote flowed <br>I could have said Whoop, there it is <br>But it would have felt so wrong to do that song <br>Try to prove I belong in a crew that strong <br>Listen, understand, this is preordain <br>This is written by God then we all came <br>Could have signed with Def Jam but Lyor changed <br>Changed his mind at the strangest time <br>He was still destined to sign a dangerous mind <br>Another cat with the grind the same as mine <br>Another son born on the fourth would come <br>He was ofcourse the one with that course to run <br>And like a ham sandwich on the softest bun <br>I refuse to eat it, I will not be defeated <br>Here to stay and get a lot completed <br>This what I got to offer, what I got is needed <br>Confident but I'm not conceited <br>And I swear, the same mistakes I made will not be repeated <br>I choose to keep paying up dues <br>Life try to beat me up like scuffed shoes <br>It was hard, doctor called me off guard <br>Same place I was born, got the rough news <br><br>We rise, we fall and pray for better days <br>Why shoot we for the stars and prayed for better aim <br>The world, the pain remained, it never change <br>Long as the sun will show, the cold is still the same <br>Just try to make history <br>Gotta make history <br>Ain't no mystery <br>Gotta make history <br>Know my history <br>Gotta make history <br>Can't shake destiny <br>Just gotta make history <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah <br>We rise, we fall and pray for better days <br>Why shoot we for the stars and prayed for better aim <br>The world, the pain remained, it never change <br>Long as the sun will show, the cold is still the same <br>Just try to make history <br>Gotta make history <br>Ain't no mystery <br>Gotta make history <br>Know my history <br>Gotta make history <br>Can't shake destiny <br>Just gotta make history <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah <br><br>The story of me, never would have knew me without it <br>And they won't make a movie about it <br>I mean, I guess they could but truely I doubt it <br>Mad friends watching Ralph McDaniels, knew me and shout it <br>Oh snap, that's Duval, he live in my building <br>Life in the PJ's, living and building <br>Whether you in Seflo or living in Tilden <br>Trying to escape men, women and children <br>A product of the same and when I got into the game <br>Initially my moms was really shocked and ashamed <br>She was like Boy you got a Bachelor's <br>And I was like Why they call it a bs <br>Bullshit walks as far is what I was taught <br>Yet I ain't had one job interview and she stressed <br>The story of me, born from the story of us <br>Studio bound, the story of us <br>My Honda's in the shop, no warranty <br>I need a new regulator, no Warren G <br>But I'mma get by, do or die <br>And then I left URI <br>I looked around and then came the yellow tape <br>I decided to sit on chrome and accelerate <br>And after that, I knew they wanted me gone and singing a swan song but I decided to let 'em wait </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Falling Season</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-05-11</td></tr><tr><th
