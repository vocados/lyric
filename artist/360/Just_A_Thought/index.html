</script><br> Just a thought <br><br>I understand people have a lot of questions <br>Maybe I could rap and give you answers with a message <br>A lot of times times what I'm rapping is offensive <br>It ain’t serious, I’m sorry if I actually offended <br>How does he ever write while he's battling with depression <br>He could end his life in the matter of a second <br>Would it matter if I end it Yes, I wanna show a <br>Disorder can be a gift it's just a matter of perspective <br>On this planet there's a faction of its members <br>They have a talent and they have to be remembered <br>What I have is a profession, and my rapping is a blessing <br>I don't even have to think all I have to be is present <br>Something higher though is tapped into my head <br>Dunno what it is but I'm just having to accept it <br>Like I have a spirit enter me, channeling an energy <br>And everything I rap it’s like I haven’t really said it <br>I probably sound like I’m gacking off my head <br>I’m clean, it’s like divinely I’ve had an intervention <br>I understand that it's challenging to get it <br>People'll misconstrue how I actually have meant it <br>For me this is proof that the galaxy is more <br>Than stars and the planets just randomly projected <br>I'm not saying that it had to be invented <br>But there’s something much bigger, no man can comprehend it <br>I believe in God, but not a man that is ascended <br>Standing in the heavens, judging every move you make <br>And banish you forever, if you’re bad then you won't get in <br>For me it’s more simple, like it’s actually a presence <br>Every life, every star, every planet and dimension <br>Everything is actually connected <br>See, there’s a God that’s ready to come alive in <br>Everybody on Earth, all you have to do is let it <br>You can be anything you actually invest in <br>You can’t wait for it though, you have to manifest it <br>The law of attraction is tragically presented <br>It’s the secret, it’s really hard to actually defend it <br>They made it out like you imagining a cheque <br>Or a house or a car, then magically you’ll get it <br>I’m a believer though, I actually digress <br>See, it goes a lot deeper though than cash and them possessions <br>If you doubt it, look at the placebo effect <br>That’s something that you have to be impressed with <br>A tablet was ingested, the tablet did nothing <br>But in thinking that he had it was still having him affected <br>See every thought you have ever thought <br>What you truly believe, and your actual intention <br>It matters, there’s so much power in your mind <br>And as far as God goes, that is practically the essence <br><br>Basically just believe in yourself <br>Embrace who you are <br>And love yourself and everyone else <br>Yeah, I love getting my vent on <br>I'm about to blow, picking up where I left off <br>To tide 'em over I just hit 'em with them songs <br>I got fifty more so I'm picking the best of <br>See I been building, I been getting my rest on <br>Yo, I can't wait to show these kids where my head's gone <br>And get my at rapping at it's tightest for the album that is timeless <br>So it’s crucial that I’m seeking the best on <br>And they keep saying I'm brave and I'm headstrong <br>But I can't help but feel like they're dead wrong <br>'Cause I can talk about my illness and issues with addiction <br>But I won't ever say where it stems from <br>'Cause barely anyone knows and I can't admit it <br>The truth really does hurt, it's too dark to give it <br>This is a life, we never wanna start to finish <br>We gotta give it everything from start to finish <br>In a team where we need to have the heart to risk it <br>Our one rule is shooting for the stars in this bitch <br>We're living such a life that it can’t be mimicked <br>Only ever setting goals if they aren’t realistic <br>Made to stand out, though we aren’t to fit in <br>Any nay-sayers and we aren’t to listen <br>And we spark a difference, making life that <br>Can’t be mimicked, the fact is though, you can't with limits <br>I was narcissistic, self-destructive, part sadistic <br>The wrong business I was partnershipping <br>I was a part of that party life, partying, then <br>Life fell apart, thank God that I parted with it <br>In this All-Star game, I’m the starter in it <br>Got that nineties fashion with the starter with it <br>People think I’m all about the fame, girls and money <br>But the fact is I really love the art of this shit <br>At the table where the winners be at <br>Fuck sticking to the rules, we ain’t limiting that <br>We get enough to jump around, make the city collapse <br>And then we fly around the world doing victory laps <br>Let’s go <br>I just wanna thank everyone who’s been mad patient with me, and stuck by me through all this fucking bullshit I’ve been through. <br>But I’m back now and I’m not going fucking anywhere. I know this game like, especially in Australia, it’s really super competitive and shit. Everyone wants to be the fucking king. I wanna be the king, I'm gonna be the king. I reckon we should all share the kingdom. Fucking every rapper should believe they’re the king anyway. <br>Support anyone who’s killing it whether you like their shit or not. Fucking even if, even if we got personal issues I’m glad that you’re kicking goals, I’m glad that you’re fucking winning. We need more support, and uh, less ego. And any young rappers coming up, shoot for the fence. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do shit, 'cause you fucking can. You can do whatever the fuck you want with the right belief and the right mindset. Go for gold.
