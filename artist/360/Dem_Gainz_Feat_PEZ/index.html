PEZ)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - 360<br><br> Ayy <br>I was smashing Skittles any minute I can I was <br>Until I started looking like the Michelin Man I did <br>So now every day I hit the gym in the tan <br>So I can be heavily armed without a pistol in hand Let's go <br>Any form of exercise there isn't a plan Nup <br>If Jesus walked on water then I'm swimming on land Check this cunt out <br>It doesn't matter when I listen to trance <br>I can't help but break into this ridiculous dance <br>It's like a faster running man, but I'm kicking and flicking my hands Woo <br>Understand I'm the shit and I think I'm the man I do <br>Yeah, bulking on these motherfuckers <br>Incredible Hulk'in' on these motherfuckers <br>I'm the dude in the gym training his upper body <br>With pants on 'cause downstairs there's nothing on me <br>Check my damn pins, not a damn thing <br>Yo, my hamstring actually looks like an actual fucking hamstring <br>The damn gym's the only thing that I'm advanced in <br>Bustin' out reps in the tempo that I dance in <br>Incredible back, impeccable traps <br>And when I'm topless I'm never relaxed, I'm flexing my abs <br>In cardio I'm the best on the map <br>I even forget where I'm at to give my memory laps Think about that <br>I'm so obsessed with fitness that I'm the definition <br>When I rap I even get the record skippin' <br>I got a thick neck, but shit legs, ayy <br>Do some fuckin' squats then, Nah, I got a big headache <br>Ah, typical 6 fuck, skip leg day <br>Cunt, we'll do it tomorrow, man, I'd rather hit chest, ayy You fuckin' pussy <br>I do ten sets on the benchpress <br>Then do ten reps on the pec deck, I've got the best chest <br>And if you want the same then listen to your sensei <br>Do it Yeah, fuckin' 6 is really making sense, ayy <br>You want the best shape Go and get your chest great <br>Fuck your legs, mate, only worry about your pecks, ayy <br>You gotta work out the best way <br>Where every day is chest day, yeah, it's Forthwrite, Dem Gainz <br><br>If you wondering where 6 been lately <br>You can catch me at the gym, baby <br>It shows I got my pecks so strong <br>Everybody sayin' that my chest so bomb This cunt's massive <br>I know you probly thinking this shit's crazy <br>Upper body is the shit, baby <br>You know I got my headphones on Check it out <br>Won't believe that it's a techno song <br>Just leave me alone Yeah <br><br>The moment that I walk in the gym <br>You're like, What the fuck's my girl doing talkin' to him Sup babe <br>A workout's better the shorter it is <br>So I'm calling it quits before it begins <br>Walk straight up and disconnect the exercise bike <br>See people looking mesmerised when I ride by Bye <br>From the time I was born I was never quite right <br>You wanna hide your flaws, I'm tryna emphasise mine <br>So while they try and get all energised, I <br>Don't give a fuck about my tris and my pecks and my bis Nah <br>I'm tryna blend in with the rest of my kind <br>And look like every white guy I've ever met in my life Okay <br>Lookin' skinny on these motherfuckers <br>See my arms Muscles are mini on these motherfuckers <br>All these lames say it's gain season It is <br>Nah, I'm tryna find ways to train so my frame weakens <br>That's a main reason <br>I spend the whole time I'm here walkin' 'round daydreaming in a daze schemin' <br>'Cause time is money and shit's expensive <br>So I ain't leavin' till I break even, yeah <br>It's hard to summarise it, but well <br>In a nutshell I won't touch a dumbbell <br>I'd rather walk up on these dickheads who are big and buff <br>While they're standing in the mirror and then interrupt <br>I hear 'em call me skinny like I give a fuck <br>I'm 'bout to get a nip and tuck just so I get skinner <br>I idolise those skinny runts bumming ciggies in the city, bruh <br>And I'm not giving up till I look similar <br>And this is sincere, I been at this gym for six years <br>People wonder why I'm even in here <br>It's 'cause I hate working upper body, man, I can't take it <br>But if there's legs being worked out then I'm partaking <br>See me half baked in my apartment <br>Stark naked doing calf raises till my heart's racin' Strained Noise <br>And I'll start pacin' till my feet'll hurt <br>And do a shitload of cleans, I don't need the jerk <br>I'll even spend a whole night in a squat rack <br>How many reps is that, PEZ I don't know, I lost track Fuck yeah <br>I want my top half lookin' like I'm on crack <br>But I want my glutes and my calves and my quads jacked <br>And if you want that too here's a template Yep <br>To get your flex game better than your best mate How <br>You gotta workout the PEZ way and only train on leg day <br>Forthwrite, Dem Gainz <br><br>If you wondering where PEZ been lately <br>You can catch me at the gym, baby <br>You know that when I flex those quads <br>They're sayin', How'd you get your legs so strong Check out his fuckin' pins <br>I know you probly thinking this shit's crazy <br>Lower body is the shit, baby <br>You know I got my headphones on Yeah <br>Best believe that it's a techno song <br>Just leave me alone </p><table class="table table-striped
