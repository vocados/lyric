Twiztid<br><br> I've been told that home's where the heart is, love don't live here no more regardless <br>I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me <br>I try everything no salvation all they do is prescribe more medication <br>I can't move <br><br>No no, I can't go home <br>I can't go home <br>I can't go home <br>I can't go home <br><br>Feelin' unwanted, feelin' sick to my stomach <br>Problems they keep on comin' regardless of makin' money <br>Hopin' someone above me could show them how they should love me <br>Inside of me's a republic of madness then I'm just stuck in recovery <br>Lookin' to sadness, rough and feelin' so tragic that every bit of my magic is taking seats in the back <br>It only comes up when I finally get my hands on a bat, it's like the whole world welcomes me back <br>It's like every problem I ever had is back from the track <br>I took reality and fallout when it casually comes falling right back, and then it's over <br>I'm either livin' to get high or I'm dyin' tryna be sober neither bringin' me closer <br>Now I'm sittin' in this room detoxin' and I'm alone, and all I wanna do is go home <br>But if I ever get myself up out of this fuckin' hole this is the only thing I wanted y'all to know, and it goes <br><br>Feelin' lost in a room and so alone, there's no changin' me so take me home <br>I am on my own I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on <br>And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do <br>And I guess there's just no fixin' wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song <br><br>Do you feel like the level you tryna get is stuck somewhere between right here and all this stupid bullshit <br>You work so hard but it seem just like nothin' matters though, it's like you make em' feel sick and fed up is there an antidote <br>To feel better be confident to be okay with the things I cannot change but that's positive and I'm the opposite <br>In a bottomless pit I'm fallin' my feelings are all around me so many sleepless nights, so many tears enough to drown me <br>Instead you learn to sleep grab a pillow and work sleep and be like a burnable fall when you can simply ride don't quit it <br>Wherever they may and possibly will beat me along my path, will I return to you to see you smile and possibly hear you laugh <br>When I bet to further more distance between me and home as long as you know I'm out there that you're never truly alone <br>And on my endless journey floating beyond the stars learning life is not eternal but home is wherever you are <br><br>Feelin' lost in a room and so alone, there's no changin' me so take me home <br>I am on my own I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on <br>And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do <br>And I guess there's just no fixin' wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song <br><br>I've been told that home's where the heart is, love don't live here no more regardless <br>I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Continuous Evilution Of Life`s ?`s</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-01-27</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rap / Hip-hop</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
