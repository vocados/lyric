</script><br> The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees <br>The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas <br>The road was a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor <br>And the highwayman came riding riding riding <br>The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door <br><br>He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin <br>A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe skin <br>They fitted with never a wrinkle his boots were up to the thigh <br>And he rode with a jewelled twinkle <br>His pistol butts a twinkle <br>His rapier hilt a twinkle, under the jewelled sky <br><br>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yard <br>And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred <br>He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there <br>But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter <br>Plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair <br><br>And dark in the old inn yard a stable wicket creaked <br>Where Tim the ostler listened his face was white and peaked <br>His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay <br>But he loved the landlord's daughter, The landlord's red lipped daughter <br>Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say <br><br>One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to night <br>But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light <br>Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day <br>Then look for me by moonlight, Watch for me by moonlight <br>I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way <br><br>He rose upright in the stirrups he scarce could reach her hand <br>But she loosened her hair i' the casement His face burnt like a brand <br>As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast <br>And he kissed its waves in the moonlight <br>Oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight <br>Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West <br><br>He did not come in the dawning he did not come at noon <br>And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon <br>When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor <br>A red coat troop came marching Marching marching <br>King George's men came marching, up to the old inn door <br><br>They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead <br>But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed <br>Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side <br>There was death at every window And hell at one dark window <br>For Bess could see, through the casement, the road that he would ride <br><br>They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest <br>They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast <br>Now keep good watch and they kissed her She heard the dead man say <br>Look for me by moonlight Watch for me by moonlight <br>I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way <br><br>She twisted her hands behind her but all the knots held good <br>She writhed her hands till here fingers were wet with sweat or blood <br>They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years <br>Till, now, on the stroke of midnight, Cold, on the stroke of midnight <br>The tip of one finger touched it The trigger at least was hers <br><br>The tip of one finger touched it she strove no more for the rest <br>Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast <br>She would not risk their hearing she would not strive again <br>For the road lay bare in the moonlight Blank and bare in the moonlight <br>And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain <br><br>Trot trot trot trot Had they heard it The horse hoofs ringing clear <br>Trot trot, trot trot, in the distance Were they deaf that they did not hear <br>Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill <br>The highwayman came riding, riding, riding <br>The red coats looked to their priming She stood up strait and still <br><br>Trot trot, in the frosty silence Trot trot, in the echoing night <br>Nearer he came and nearer Her face was like a light <br>Her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath <br>Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight <br>Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death <br><br>He turned he spurred to the West he did not know who stood Bowed <br>With her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood <br>Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear <br>How Bess, the landlord's daughter, The landlord's black eyed daughter <br>Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there <br><br>Back,he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky <br>With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high <br>Blood red were his spurs i' the golden noon wine red was his velvet coat <br>When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on the highway <br>And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat <br><br>And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees <br>When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas <br>When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor <br>A highwayman comes riding riding riding <br>A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn door <br><br>Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn yard <br>And he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred <br>He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there <br>But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter <br>Plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Roll, Truck, Roll</td></tr><tr><th
