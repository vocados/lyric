</script> <p>The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees</br>The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas</br>The road was a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor</br>And the highwayman came riding riding riding</br>The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door</br>He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin</br>A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe skin</br>They fitted with never a wrinkle his boots were up to the thigh</br>And he rode with a jewelled twinkle</br>His pistol butts a twinkle</br>His rapier hilt a twinkle, under the jewelled sky</br>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yard</br>And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred</br>He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there</br>But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter</br>Plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair</br>And dark in the old inn yard a stable wicket creaked</br>Where Tim the ostler listened his face was white and peaked</br>His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay</br>But he loved the landlord's daughter, The landlord's red lipped daughter</br>Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say</br>One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to night</br>But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light</br>Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day</br>Then look for me by moonlight, Watch for me by moonlight</br>I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way</br>He rose upright in the stirrups he scarce could reach her hand</br>But she loosened her hair i' the casement His face burnt like a brand</br>As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast</br>And he kissed its waves in the moonlight</br>Oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight</br>Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West</br>He did not come in the dawning he did not come at noon</br>And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon</br>When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor</br>A red coat troop came marching Marching marching</br>King George's men came marching, up to the old inn door</br>They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead</br>But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed</br>Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side</br>There was death at every window And hell at one dark window</br>For Bess could see, through the casement, the road that he would ride</br>They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest</br>They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast</br>Now keep good watch and they kissed her She heard the dead man say</br>Look for me by moonlight Watch for me by moonlight</br>I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way</br>She twisted her hands behind her but all the knots held good</br>She writhed her hands till here fingers were wet with sweat or blood</br>They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years</br>Till, now, on the stroke of midnight, Cold, on the stroke of midnight</br>The tip of one finger touched it The trigger at least was hers</br>The tip of one finger touched it she strove no more for the rest</br>Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast</br>She would not risk their hearing she would not strive again</br>For the road lay bare in the moonlight Blank and bare in the moonlight</br>And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain</br>Trot trot trot trot Had they heard it The horse hoofs ringing clear</br>Trot trot, trot trot, in the distance Were they deaf that they did not hear</br>Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill</br>The highwayman came riding, riding, riding</br>The red coats looked to their priming She stood up strait and still</br>Trot trot, in the frosty silence Trot trot, in the echoing night</br>Nearer he came and nearer Her face was like a light</br>Her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath</br>Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight</br>Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death</br>He turned he spurred to the West he did not know who stood Bowed</br>With her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood</br>Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear</br>How Bess, the landlord's daughter, The landlord's black eyed daughter</br>Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there</br>Back,he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky</br>With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high</br>Blood red were his spurs i' the golden noon wine red was his velvet coat</br>When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on the highway</br>And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat</br>And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees</br>When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas</br>When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor</br>A highwayman comes riding riding riding</br>A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn door</br>Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn yard</br>And he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred</br>He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there</br>But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter</br>Plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair<h2
