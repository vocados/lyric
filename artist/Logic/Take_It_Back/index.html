<br>Take it way way back to the first white man <br>At the very moment when they looked around and said <br>Fuck it, I'ma steal this land <br><br>Take it back, take it way back <br>Take it way, way back to about 1990 <br>Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland <br>736 am, where a biracial baby was born <br>To a black father and a white mother <br>Father that wasn't there <br>Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs <br>Same as his mom <br>Way, way back <br>So I'm gonna tell you about that, right <br>And I'm gonna tell you about how <br>All this young boy ever wanted was happiness <br>All he ever wanted was positivity <br>All he ever wanted to do was entertain <br>And this boy went through hell <br>You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy <br>'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have <br>All these black babies with black men but you racist <br>Like bitch, that don't make no sense, but it is what it is <br>You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger <br>The kids at school callin' him a cracker <br>Identifying as black, looking as white <br>Being told what you can or can't be <br>This kid went through everything <br>He went through <br>He saw narcotics in the household <br>Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped <br>There was crazy shit that happened to this kid <br>And he persevered while the whole world said <br>What they said <br>Said you wouldn't be shit <br>You ain't gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' <br>Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing <br>And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere <br>And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity <br>See, he always saw things from two sides <br>He always saw things from two sides <br>He always knew that the message <br>Everybody was born equal <br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation <br>He knew that because he saw that <br>Take it back, take it way back <br>Take it way <br>Because he was stripped and torn down <br>By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated <br>And that did not know <br>And he was stripped and he was torn down <br>By his white side that did not know <br>These people that are ignorant <br>That cannot see the bigger picture <br>That must fight and kill and murder each other <br>But once again, all he ever wanted to do <br>Was spread a message of equality <br>For every man, woman, and child <br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation <br>Take it back, take it way back <br>Take it way, way back to the first <br>Now imagine this child growing up <br>And seeing the craziest shit <br>Being a part of the craziest shit <br>Running around with the wrong people <br>Running around with guns and knives <br>And fighting and stealing and, and all this <br>Because he didn't know, he didn't know <br>But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right <br>And he knew that he needed to get away from it <br>Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old <br>This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself <br>Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings <br>And then he would then come home <br>To about eight or nine hours of sleep <br>But spend four, five, six hours of that <br>Working on music, persevering <br>Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror <br>And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people <br>Just chanting his name <br>Hoping that it would happen <br>But the, but the, but the world said no <br>Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no <br>Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka <br>No no <br>Take it back, take it way back <br>Take it way, way back to the first <br>And he said fuck that <br>He said peace, love, and positivity <br>He said equality for all man <br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah <br>Now I want you to also imagine <br>People telling him that he did not live this life <br>You just a white boy <br>You ain't never experienced that shit <br>You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there <br>Oh no, no, we know, we weren't there <br>We didn't live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household <br>We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household <br>We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside <br>Outside, outside, outside, outside <br>And since you white, you gotta have money, right <br>And this young man persevered in spite <br>Of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would never be <br>Take it back, take it way back <br>Take it way, way back to the first black <br>And that man is here today, proud <br>A lover of all human beings <br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah <br>And he's here to say <br>Even though we're all born and created equal <br>We are not treated equally <br>There's extremists on every side <br>And you should just do your best to live life <br>And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe <br>As long as they're not hurtin' anybody <br>You can believe they're going to hell <br>You can believe it's not right <br>You can believe you're superior, fine <br>Just stop killing each other </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th
