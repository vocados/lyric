this land</br>Take it back, take it way back</br>Take it way, way back to about 1990</br>Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland</br>736 am, where a biracial baby was born</br>To a black father and a white mother</br>Father that wasn't there</br>Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs</br>Same as his mom</br>Way, way back</br>So I'm gonna tell you about that, right</br>And I'm gonna tell you about how</br>All this young boy ever wanted was happiness</br>All he ever wanted was positivity</br>All he ever wanted to do was entertain</br>And this boy went through hell</br>You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy</br>'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have</br>All these black babies with black men but you racist</br>Like bitch, that don't make no sense, but it is what it is</br>You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger</br>The kids at school callin' him a cracker</br>Identifying as black, looking as white</br>Being told what you can or can't be</br>This kid went through everything</br>He went through</br>He saw narcotics in the household</br>Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped</br>There was crazy shit that happened to this kid</br>And he persevered while the whole world said</br>What they said</br>Said you wouldn't be shit</br>You ain't gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'</br>Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing</br>And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere</br>And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity</br>See, he always saw things from two sides</br>He always saw things from two sides</br>He always knew that the message</br>Everybody was born equal</br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation</br>He knew that because he saw that</br>Take it back, take it way back</br>Take it way</br>Because he was stripped and torn down</br>By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated</br>And that did not know</br>And he was stripped and he was torn down</br>By his white side that did not know</br>These people that are ignorant</br>That cannot see the bigger picture</br>That must fight and kill and murder each other</br>But once again, all he ever wanted to do</br>Was spread a message of equality</br>For every man, woman, and child</br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation</br>Take it back, take it way back</br>Take it way, way back to the first</br>Now imagine this child growing up</br>And seeing the craziest shit</br>Being a part of the craziest shit</br>Running around with the wrong people</br>Running around with guns and knives</br>And fighting and stealing and, and all this</br>Because he didn't know, he didn't know</br>But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right</br>And he knew that he needed to get away from it</br>Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old</br>This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself</br>Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings</br>And then he would then come home</br>To about eight or nine hours of sleep</br>But spend four, five, six hours of that</br>Working on music, persevering</br>Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror</br>And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people</br>Just chanting his name</br>Hoping that it would happen</br>But the, but the, but the world said no</br>Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no</br>Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka</br>No no</br>Take it back, take it way back</br>Take it way, way back to the first</br>And he said fuck that</br>He said peace, love, and positivity</br>He said equality for all man</br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah</br>Now I want you to also imagine</br>People telling him that he did not live this life</br>You just a white boy</br>You ain't never experienced that shit</br>You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there</br>Oh no, no, we know, we weren't there</br>We didn't live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household</br>We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household</br>We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside</br>Outside, outside, outside, outside</br>And since you white, you gotta have money, right</br>And this young man persevered in spite</br>Of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would never be</br>Take it back, take it way back</br>Take it way, way back to the first black</br>And that man is here today, proud</br>A lover of all human beings</br>Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah</br>And he's here to say</br>Even though we're all born and created equal</br>We are not treated equally</br>There's extremists on every side</br>And you should just do your best to live life</br>And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe</br>As long as they're not hurtin' anybody</br>You can believe they're going to hell</br>You can believe it's not right</br>You can believe you're superior, fine</br>Just stop killing each other<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Everybody</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-05-08</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap / Hip-hop</h3></p> </div>
