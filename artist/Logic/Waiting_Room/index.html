are we waiting for</br>God Rebirth</br>Atom Rebirth Like reincarnation</br>God If that's what you wanna call it</br>Atom What the fuck you mean, If that's what I wanna call it Either this is what it is, or this is what it ain't</br>God Sure</br>Atom Chu mean Ugh, this mothafucka</br>Atom A'ight, lemme get this straight every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn</br>God You know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13</br>Atom Mandarin</br>God And a girl</br>Atom What Nah, bruh, you fuckin' wit' me Like, Jesus Christ</br>God He was here too</br>Atom What Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right</br>God Well I'm about to reincarnate you, Atom I'd say everyone kinda got it right</br>Atom This is a whole lot to take in</br>God I know Trust me, I've been there</br>Atom So, how many times have I been reincarnated</br>God Many, many, many, many, many times</br>Atom If it's so many times, why don't I remember</br>God If we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return</br>Atom What</br>God I'm actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron</br>Atom Word, ayy, that sounds important</br>God Oh, yes You own 40,000 acres</br>Atom Goddamn Oh, I'm sorry</br>God Ha, it's quite alright</br>Atom Well, at least I'm not poor no more</br>God Well, sure With all that land and the hundreds of slaves you'll own</br>Atom Slaves Aw, hell nah No, no, no, no, look, look, look how you gonna take a black man, send him back in time, and now I gotta own slaves</br>God Well, if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, sets them free</br>Atom No That does not make me feel better at all Wait, hold up, I just realized you said you're gonna send me back in time</br>God Well, I'm not really sending you back in time That doesn't exist where I come from, only in your universe</br>Atom Well, where are you from</br>God Honestly, Atom, even if I explained where I came from, or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn't understand</br>Atom But if there's others like you, how can you be god</br>God Atom, I said you wouldn't understand</br>Atom So what's the point of doing all this</br>God Really</br>Atom What</br>God A little cliche, don't you think Essentially asking me the meaning of life</br>Atom Well, I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can't remember none of this</br>God Atom, come here The meaning of life, the reason I created this place, is so that you can grow and mature</br>Atom Like the human race Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature Mature into what We can't even get along</br>God No, Atom, you It's for you, you to mature</br>Atom I don't understand</br>God I created this place for you, Atom This entire place was made for you Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow and mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this just a little more each time</br>Atom Just me Wait, what about everybody else</br>God Atom, there is no one else</br>Atom I don't understand</br>God Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth</br>Atom Wait, I'm everyone</br>God Ah yes, now you are beginning to see it</br>Atom So I'm like, everyone that ever existed on Earth, ever</br>God Earth Ha, that's cute Earth was just your birthplace Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia</br>Atom Wait, that is so much Too much to take in I'm every human being that ever lived</br>God Or ever will live, yes</br>Atom I'm Jesus</br>God And all of his disciples</br>Atom I'm Hitler</br>God And the millions he murdered</br>Atom That's deep</br>God You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another, you were committing against yourself and every act of love and hand of kindness, you also extended unto yourself</br>Atom God, why do all this</br>God Someday, long from now, you will become like me You will mature to become what I am</br>Atom I'm a god</br>God No, not yet You see, I was once where you stand right now It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe that I may take you from this place Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, loving and hateful person, it is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Everybody</h2><h3
