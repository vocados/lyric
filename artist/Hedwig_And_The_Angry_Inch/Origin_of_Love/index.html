while they read <br>And they never knew nothing of love <br>It was before the origin of love <br>The origin of love <br><br>And there were three sexes then <br>One that looked like two men <br>Glued up back to back <br>Called the children of the sun <br>And similiar in shape and girth <br>Was the children of the earth <br>They looked like two girls rolled up in one <br>And the children of the moon <br>Were like a fork stuck on a spoon <br>They were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son <br>The origin of love <br><br>Now the gods grew quite scared <br>Of our strength and defiance <br>And Thor said "I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer <br>Like I killed the giants" <br>But the Zeus said "No <br>You better let me use my lightning like scissors <br>Like I cut the legs off the whales <br>Dinosaurs into lizards" <br>Then he grabbed up some bolts <br>And he let out a laugh <br>Said "I'll split them right down the middle <br>Gonna cut them right up in half" <br>And the storm clouds gathered above <br>Into great balls of fire <br><br>And then fire shot down from the sky in bolts <br>Like shining blades of a knife <br>And it ripped right through the flesh <br>Of the children of the sun and the moon <br>And the earth <br>And some Indian god sewed the wound up <br>Into a hole <br>Pulled it 'round to our bellies <br>To remind us the price we pay <br>And Osiris and the gods of the nile <br>Gathered up a big storm <br>To blow a hurricane <br>To scatter us away <br>In a flood of wind and rain <br>And a sea of tidal waves <br>To wash us all away <br>And if we don't behave <br>They'll cut us down again <br>We'll be hopping around on one foot <br>And looking through one eye <br><br>Last time I saw you <br>We just split in two <br>You was looking at me <br>I was looking at you <br>You had a way so familiar <br>But I could not recognize <br>'cause you had blood in your face <br>And I had blood in my eyes <br>But I could swear by your expression <br>That the pain down in your soul <br>Was the same as the one down in mine <br>That's the pain <br>That cuts a straight line down through the heart <br>We call it love <br>We wrapped our arms around each other <br>Trying to shove ourselves back together <br>We were making love <br>Making love <br>It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago <br>When by the mighty hand of Jove <br>It was a sad story how we became <br>Lonely two-legged creatures <br>It's the story <br>The origin of love <br>That's the origin of love </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Hedwig and the Angry Inch - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (영화 `헤드윅` OST)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2015-08-05</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Foreign Movie</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
