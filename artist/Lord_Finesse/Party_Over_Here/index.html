shame</br>I get raw for you and yours, bound to score</br>For sure, I'm all that plus more</br>I'm not stopping here, I got lots to share</br>I kick a party til I'm old in a rocking chair</br>Throw rhymes like Saluchi, kicking like Bruce Lee</br>I make G's off a pen and some looseleaf</br>I'm gone with the wind as soon as I begin</br>And if my girl act funny, I bag her friend</br>Cause I'm no joke when it comes to a rap tune</br>Stuff brothers kick I would have flushed in the bathroom</br>I get looser as a dope track producer</br>Girls got game but I doubt they could juice a</br>Brother that's stronger whenever I get on a</br>System, because I'm a top notch performer</br>I mingle because I'm single, a brother with fly taste</br>After this party there's another one at my place</br>Finesse is here, party people be aware</br>Throw your hands in the are because there's a party over here</br>Is it a party over here There's a party over here Repeat 3x</br>So where's the party at Yo, the party's over here</br>Is it a party over here There's a party over here Repeat 3x</br>So where's the party at Yo, the party's over here</br>Now I rock parties and keep concerts pumping</br>Girls that's single, we can probably work something</br>Let me handle this, Finesse is living scandalous</br>I got props from here to Los Angeles</br>Far from soup, I roll like a troop</br>I don't front, I told you girls by the group</br>So don't try to play me, I'm strictly for the ladies</br>Finesse, what's up You looking good, baby</br>We swing with this brother and don't just sit there</br>Come lounge at my crib What's gonna happen when we get there</br>It's no scam, it's just a smooth slick plan</br>Meet me outside and have a friend for my man</br>So all you nad looking girls that like me</br>We can swing this, let's Do the Right Thing like Spike Lee</br>I'm the one you demand for, skills is enhanced more</br>You know this man's law, so slide on the dance floor</br>With the rap singer with the lyrics that linger</br>It won't hurt to clap your hands or snap your fingers</br>Wave your arms from side to side</br>Finesse is live, and this is my 9 to 5</br>And I don't need nobody to add help</br>Can I kick it Go ahead with your bad self</br>I drop slang when I'm doing my thing</br>I can show and prove why others can't hang</br>One to a few, a crew or a gang</br>I'm ending shit off with a bang</br>I don't care how you dance, you can stand wherever</br>But when I rap just put your damn hands together</br>I flip the lids of adults and kids</br>So yo Showbiz, take 'em to the bridge</br>Here we go here we go, come on come on</br>Here we go here we go, come on come on</br>Here we go here we go, come on come on</br>Here we go here we go, come on

the way I'm throwing down and</br>Finesse what you doing Yeah baby, I'm just lounging</br>I'm larger than a gym that's packed to the rim</br>Give me the cash, the prop, the fame, and I'm in</br>Whether lounging or maxing, chilling or relaxing</br>It won't hurt to check me out in live action</br>Step in, watch Mike Smooth spin</br>For ladies and men doors open at 1000</br>PM, so push your Benz or your BM</br>Finesse is live on the mic so come and see him</br>With the new flavor, that's why I'm gonna stay fly</br>It won't hurt to lounge and drop by and say hi</br>So too amazing whenever a trey I kick</br>Ballistics, science, and all that other flavor</br>I pump my rhymes like a barbell</br>Got more flavor than the neighborhood Carvell's</br>I'm better than Keith, I do more
