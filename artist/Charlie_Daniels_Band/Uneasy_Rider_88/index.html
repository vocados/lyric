</script> <p>Me and my buddy got us a wild hair</br>And figured we wanted to go somewhere</br>So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet</br>We had a little bit of money</br>And a whole lot of show</br>And with Hank Jr blaring on the radio</br>We got us a tank full of gas</br>And we was on our way</br>We figured we'd go down to New Orleans</br>We were barrelling down old 17</br>When a man with a blinking red light</br>Was on our tail</br>He said you were doing 60 in a 45</br>But I'm gonna let you go this time</br>But if I catch you again</br>I'm gonna slap you in the county jail</br>We said thank you sir you sure been nice</br>And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice</br>And we were Southbound and down with the wind</br>Blowing in our faces</br>We kept on rolling and pretty soon</br>The radio was cooking out a Haggard tune</br>And we were pulling into Houston</br>Checking out all them places</br>I was feeling dry and I said I think</br>We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink</br>And old Jim said yeah 'cause we got time to kill</br>We kept on rolling and I seen this spot</br>And we pulled into the parking lot</br>Of this place called the Cloud Nine Bar and Grill</br>We walked through the door</br>And the place was jammed</br>The lights were low they had a punk rock band</br>And some orange haired feller singing about suicide</br>I said Jim this ain't our kind of place</br>He said well let's just have one round anyway</br>So against my better judgement we walked on inside</br>Went up to the bar and we sat down</br>This feller walked up and said I'll buy this round</br>And he sat down on the barstool next to Jim</br>He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy</br>He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes</br>And everybody in that place looked just about like him</br>I said Jim this ain't our kind of bar</br>Let's just go on out and get back in the car</br>'Cause there's gonna be trouble</br>Ain't no sense in taking a chance</br>We was getting up getting ready to leave</br>When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve</br>And this good looking girl was asking my buddy to dance</br>I said Jim don't do it there's something missing</br>There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing</br>There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose</br>He said partner I just can't turn this down</br>You just go over there and have one more round</br>And I'll dance with the lady</br>And we'll get on down the road</br>So he walked away and left me alone</br>But this funny looking feller kept coming on</br>And he was making me mad with some of the things he said</br>Then he put his hand on my knee</br>I said if you don't get your paw off me</br>I'm gonna locate your nose around</br>The other side of your head</br>He said I love it when you get that fire in your eye</br>I said well partner try this on for size</br>And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light</br>Everybody in that place must have been his friend</br>They all headed for me I said this is the end</br>But where I come from we don't give up</br>Without a fight</br>They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing</br>I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing</br>I was holding my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two</br>Old Jim come running up out of the blue</br>And that gal he was with come running up too</br>And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe</br>I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand</br>And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man</br>And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor</br>He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun</br>Smeared his lipstick made his makeup run</br>And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door</br>We lit out of there in that Chevrolet</br>I put in on the floor and it stayed that way</br>We were going down the highway</br>Doing about a hundred and ten</br>We were headed for home and we was getting nearer</br>Then a red light came on the rear view mirror</br>And that same blame cop was pulling us over again</br>Now I'm sitting here in this county jail</br>I had to call my daddy to go our bail</br>But I learned me a lesson</br>That I never will forget again</br>I've done give up drinking I've give up bars</br>And running around the country in souped up cars</br>I'm going back where the women are women</br>And the men are men<h2
