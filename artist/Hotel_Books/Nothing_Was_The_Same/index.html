Hotel Books<br><br> I chose to believe every word I was fed <br>And I thought the coals on my back were a product <br>Of the lack you left when you stepped back <br>And racked your brain for a reason to stay <br>But you could not seem to formulate any such thought in your head <br><br>So you left with nothing more than a reason you kept silent <br>And my mind would riot stuck in self perpetuated mental violence <br>And dreams kept private <br>The ambition to fix this wish list of selfish misfit realist missions <br>Contained within a vision of wishful thinking <br>And sinking deep into a new bit of <br>Misproportioned emotions leaking through a seeping truth <br>Constructed by my need to feel important <br>When you would look back and think <br>Of all the little things that you regret <br>I just wanted you to think of me when you think back <br>To all those little things that you regret <br><br>I spent so much time convincing myself that the rest of this mess <br>That I stressed within this relationship was a product of the world's oppressions <br>Not my deep desire to be needed <br>And it's hard to admit but I guess I've come to terms with the fact <br>That I just want to be needed <br>And I convinced myself that I needed to be needed <br>And if that was true, I would still be smiling <br>Like you still today but for different reasons <br><br>I chose to dismiss the possible instance <br>That the lips I love to kiss could form the words goodbye <br>And it was a simple lie but I told it to you <br>And like the captain of a sinking ship choosing to believe <br>The bottom of the ocean was a better source of oxygen <br>It's so nice and I still chose to believe I misinterpreted your dialect <br>And everything you said about it <br>Your diction, your diatribe, posture, body language and connotations <br>All pointed in the same direction <br>The selection of contingent messages postponed until further notice <br>Because I was ashamed to admit the problem <br>And pretend your happiness came from me <br>And that your happiness was important <br><br>But we aborted the sorted truths we once distorted <br>When I saw the shape of your dress when you wore it <br>And that was enough until it wasn't <br>And that's when you finally felt supported <br>So the others courted you and you mentally recorded <br>And endorsed the force perform of compliments you received came in <br>And you felt empowered enough to take your final bow <br>And find love within the arms of another instead of this heart of mine <br><br>And that's fine because I would do the same <br>And I would leave me Not because I'm useless <br>And not because I'm broken <br>Not because I'm sad and not because I'm worthless <br>But because I saw value in your smile but not in your values <br>And I'm sorry, and I love you <br><br>And that's why I can finally sleep at night <br>Because you are free and you can thrive <br>And I'm just happy I got to be a part of your life <br>I'm just happy I got to be a part of the journey <br>That you call your life <br>And I finally feel fine because I spent so long trying <br>To change you, not realizing I was the one who needed to change <br>I was selfish to assume you loved me more than you love yourself <br>Even though I never felt the same And there's so many things <br>That my selfishness tried to take away but you were the one <br>That was the hardest to watch walk away <br>But thank you for letting me be a part of everything <br>You were building and creating and finding truth and life <br>And you were relating so much beauty, and I love you, and I'm sorry <br><br>Thank you for letting me be a part of your journey <br>Thank you for letting me be me <br>And thank you for setting me free <br>And showing me love in its full capacity <br><br>Thank you for letting me be a part of your journey Thank you for letting me be me Thank you for setting me free and showing me love in its full capacity </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Run Wild, Young Beauty</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-06-09</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
