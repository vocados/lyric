ain't leave when I was broke</br>Yeah</br>[Pre-Chorus]</br>I had to climb out the sewer</br>Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'</br>Hold me down</br>Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it</br>Sometimes I try to be there for you</br>And my plan, it don't go like I want it</br>Watch me roll this dope, watch me</br>Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me</br>[Chorus]</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>One thing that she didn't do</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave</br>I don't ever tell her what I go through</br>But how she act, I know she won't</br>I can see you was givin' up</br>And that's what killed me the most</br>[Verse 1]</br>Came out the sewer, it's stankin'</br>Go in the booth and I'm blankin'</br>Slept with my tool on the blanket</br>Like I'm the son of Michael</br>All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful</br>They see my heart has been damaged</br>You see the whip Panoramic</br>You see I made it, you witnessed progression</br>I was talkin' like I knew I was destined</br>I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it</br>Whether you like it, you gotta admit it</br>Then I change up your location</br>Then I pull up in that Wraith</br>Have I fulfilled all your dreams?</br>I gave you checks</br>So you're checkin' it off on your wish list</br>You get Ferraris right now</br>We doin' Cali right now</br>I had to do it</br>[Pre-Chorus]</br>I had to climb out the sewer</br>Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'</br>Hold me down</br>Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it</br>Sometimes I try to be there for you</br>And my plan, it don't go like I want it</br>Watch me roll this dope, watch me</br>Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me</br>[Chorus]</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>One thing that she didn't do</br>She ain't leave when I was broke</br>She ain't leave</br>I don't ever tell her what I go through</br>But how she act, I know she won't</br>I can see you was givin' up</br>And that's what killed me the most</br>[Verse 2]</br>We goin' shoppin' right now</br>I see they copy right now</br>I see they're watchin' right now</br>They didn't know I was just plottin' right now</br>I've been executin' the play for a while</br>Witnessed trappin', baby walk down the aisle</br>I got a few rings on me now</br>Had to change my team and my style</br>You can't intervene on my craft</br>You better turn your back right now</br>Ain't no turnin' back right now</br>I can't let you cramp my style</br>If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl</br>Starin' right back 'cause you lookin' like cow</br>You gettin' no sniff, sleepin' with the flowers</br>She understand everything I go through</br>Gutta nigga always</br>[Pre-Chorus]</br>I had to climb out the sewer</br>Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'</br>Hold me down</br>Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it</br>Sometimes I try to be there for you</br>And my plan, it don't go like I want it</br>Watch me roll this dope, watch me</br>Hit
