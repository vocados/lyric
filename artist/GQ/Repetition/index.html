another day</br>That's why I get up</br>Try and work it out but shit it's hard for me to sit up</br>Girl hit me I ain't pick up, we gonna talk later</br>Another story with some lost pages</br>Lose sleep like it's Las Vegas</br>Not a bit early</br>They don't see me they feel me, Big Shirley</br>Hm, Now I'm in a zone can't shoot me out it</br>Why I feel alone when the room is crowded?</br>Back when picking friends was a hard task</br>Praying and wishing I had what the stars had</br>Bad memories, light them up, burn them down</br>Dreams switch more than Hakeem with a turn around</br>I'm on the team but they don't know it, Rudy Fame</br>A few dots my, my circle smaller than coodie games</br>Partly cloudy, I ring shit</br>He outty Oakland, California Represent it proudly</br>Liars, like how he just create the truth like Geppetto</br>My mind is a cave and the booth is my echo</br>Smooth as a flute with a chello, Hello</br>Going for the green I ain't slowing for the yellow</br>I'm up there, I don't think Manute's on my level</br>Fully equipped I don't think your coupes on my level</br>I will poop on your level</br>I'm talking so high I gotta sky dive nigga</br>Just to stoop to your level</br>Commute through the treble, no trouble</br>Would try to explain the pain but shit the rain leave puddles</br>Bad when you struggle as a free man see man</br>A lot of niggas tried fell short like weeman</br>And for my nigga Sid, See I told you how i be anddd</br>Going bananas like I'm swingin on a tree branch</br>Hard trying to see what don't exist</br>Just making up for everything I missed and cause of this</br>I made a promise to myself, get right before the light come</br>Might run to it if it's bright enough, folk cut out</br>Don't mean nothing to me I knife them up</br>Air flights not for me to hype them up</br>Dominoes line them up Until I</br>No longer can breath and my eyes are shut</br>See I love it for the fact that they ain't like it much</br>Yeah</br>What's not for them is life to us</br>With only one, That's why I care about it twice as much</br>Long days, eyes blood shot, Ruby frames</br>It's been a year since you hit me up Julie James</br>Linebacker for luck, I got a right to rush</br>I love a woman with class that still spike a punch</br>Up in an Autumn piece, cool when I spark the leaf</br>Niggas run & gun play as smart as Keith</br>Remote flicking looking for entertainment</br>Pulp fiction, juicing it for arrangements</br>I'm in love with it, see who I'm engaged with</br>Wake them up and put them to sleep like, where the days went?</br>Went days saying my days will turn to them days</br>And them days done turned to Wednesday</br>Tomorrows finally here</br>Finally clear to me this blurred vision ain't scaring me</br>Comparing me and what I see to bird vision, parakeet</br>It's like they daring me to succeed</br>Money, clothes and sunflower hoes that like to suck seeds</br>Fuck needs</br>I need what I want and what I want is what I strive for</br>Foot away like 5'4''</br>Fuck I gotta lie for, I'm here</br>But I ride slow, higher than my pride go</br>See I know a lot of shit, shit that only I know</br>For those just tuning in welcome to my show</br>I'm not your average guy, Joe</br>I'm heartfelt like Kadeem Hardison, falling off a rim</br>You don't always have to write what's right to hold a pen</br>And So the sin snowballs into the coffee</br>But if the magic ain't hot, it's no Frosty</br>Fought me for being submitted like good art</br>Could have ended up bad from having a good start</br>Could have parted like seas but please</br>I'd rather lead my people through rough streams</br>I too, be a canoe, who knew</br>Or could imagine my pattern as are now</br>Just play and keep faith on my side like argyle</br>Stars now shine brighter than fire under a pot</br>Though I still can't seem to cook from what I got</br>Maybe my recipe is slightly off measurement</br>They talk shit but I ignore it like a peppermint</br>Ready to roll but it's rocky as a sediment</br>Road that I know so well but yet have never went</br>In that direction, protection from the signs</br>Painting my life portrait trying to stay inside the line</br>Then it go</br>Repetition</br>Why the effort missing?</br>Do they hear it all?</br>Are they even listening?</br>Repetition</br>Why the effort missing?</br>Do they hear it all?</br>I hope they was listening, listening</br>Yeah</br>Hope they was listening listening</br>Yeah</br>Hope they was listening listening</br>Bright Lady Nights</br>And my niggas<h2
