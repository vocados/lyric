nothing left in me but doubt</br>I picked up a pen</br>And wrote my way out I wrote my way out</br>I picked up the pen like Hamilton</br>Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em</br>No political power, just lyrical power</br>Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours</br>Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up</br>My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger</br>Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence</br>Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant</br>Flickerin' lights inside my project hall</br>Sickenin', the mice crawl all night

tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit</br>The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch</br>Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans</br>Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border</br>That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape</br>Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak</br>I persevered, composition, I kept it close</br>Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear</br>Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it</br>Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'</br>This poetry in motion, I'm a poet</br>I wrote my way out</br>When the world turned its back on me</br>I was up against the wall</br>I had no foundation</br>No friends and no family to catch my fall</br>Running on empty, there was nothing left in me but doubt</br>I picked up a pen</br>And wrote my way out I wrote my way out</br>High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck</br>Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check</br>My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak</br>In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back</br>Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin'</br>Oh, you think you smart Blah Start bleedin'</br>My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back</br>Sister tapped my brains, said, pssh, you'll get 'em right back</br>Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in</br>The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless</br>These sentences are endless, so what if they
