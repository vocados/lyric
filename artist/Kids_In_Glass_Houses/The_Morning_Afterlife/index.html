</script><br> Give me one good reason why I should trust Or see the good in both of us When we came with love and left with lust When we came with lies we’ve learnt to trust Give me good reason to believe in all I do and all I see And all I see We slip into something more comfortable They like you best when you are vulnerable Just when you thought the world was yours When you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night The night, night Just when you thought the world was yours When you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night The night, night The night, night The night, night Give me one good reason why I should trust In all these things that turn to dust When we beg we get down on our knees When we’re full we want to be empty You loved the chase til it slowed down You loved the hunt til it hit town Til it hit town Slip into something invincible Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night The night, night Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night The night, night The night, night The night, night Who do you trust when all I know is at home in All the wars? And I’ve been somewhere, I’ve been somewhere Who do you turn to when the best of everyone you Knew has turned on you? I’ve been somewhere, I’ve been somewhere Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night, night Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough night, night Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night The night, night Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough night, night Just when you thought the world was yours Just when you thought you had it all Just when you thought you’d done enough to get You through the night, The night, night </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Dirt (Special Edition)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2010-03-26</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
