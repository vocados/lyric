up on the dole in a single parent family <br>Been through a little bit of tragedy <br>Yes I was around drugs and violence before the day that I started secondary <br>And that's part of it not half of it <br>Get the picture, the rest ain't necessary <br>Growin' up, got a little caught up <br>But that ain't even half of my life <br>I was also given the knowledge of self <br>That is all we actually need to survive <br>If you saw me aged 9, reading Malcolm just fine <br>Teachers still treated me stupid <br>Students that couldn't speak English, they put me in groups with <br>And the irony is some of the first man to give me schoolin' <br>You would call gangsters but I already explained, we know what the truth is <br>They used to say 'Don't be like me' <br>Yeah I got a name and dough on the street <br>Night time comes, I can't sleep <br>And that's the part that rappers don't speak <br>We don't hit the road cos we are thugs <br>Don't come out the womb, wanna sell drugs <br>If we got the right guidance and love <br>Would we fight people just like us <br>How could I knock the hustle to get by <br>How do you think I ate as a child <br>Judge no one, done many things wrong <br>I just don't boast about it songs <br>But listen to my older bars <br>I was just as confused as you probably are <br>But you grow and you learn <br>Travel and f*** up <br>One too many man you know get cut up <br>One too many man that could've been doctors <br>End up spending their whole life boxed up <br>You learn, if you study <br>Its all set out just to make them money <br>No cover, it's all about getting poor people to fight with one another <br>So its logical that us killing our brothers <br>Dissin' our mothers <br>Is right in line with the dominant philosophy of our time <br>But time is a cycle, not a line <br>Comes back around you regain your mind <br>You be ready for the energy I channel in my rhymes <br>Remedy the pedigree, the jeopardy of mine <br>When the world's this f***ed up, lethargy's a crime <br>We can all fight with our brothers over crumbs <br>Far harder to fight the one who makes guns <br>We can all talk sh** and get two dollars <br>Far harder to be the one who seeks knowledge <br>If we understood economics <br>We'd know money's nothin' <br>Think nothing of it <br>Money is a means to get wealth, not the wealth itself <br>Don't get confused, I'm far from broke <br>All that you see me do I own <br>But I won't hang what I make around my neck <br>I know from where that the diamonds came <br>But I do quite literally own a library <br>That definitely costs more than your chain <br>And businesses, and properties <br>Far from starvin', I eat quite properly <br>And I don't care, just in it for the kids <br>Who need to know that you're not broke to listen <br>Don't know an asset from a liability <br>They've never been shown or told the difference <br>So they don't change situations <br>Richest man in Britain is Asian <br>That's significant, not coincidence <br>Asian people build businesses <br>Not by flossin going out shoppin' <br>Giving out their culture for everyone's profit <br>Who run's Bollywood Indian people <br>Who owns our shit <br>So we shake our arse and dance <br>As if racism just upped and vanished <br>But has it No its right on course <br>You're beaten so bad, you're trained to ignore <br>Let me not just make sweeping statements <br>Gimme a second, I'll explain it <br>For small amounts of drug possession there's more black people in jail in America than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together <br>You can say they're just locking up thugs <br>Imagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs <br>Oh that's right, that'd be your kids <br>Bigger than that what is going on with this <br>Prison in America's a private business <br>They get paid 50k per year per inmate by the State, just wait <br>Also legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves <br>Cheap slave labour, big corporations <br>They come out of jail, can't get a job <br>So when we celebrate going to jail <br>We are LITERALLY CELEBRATING ENSLAVEMENT <br>Add to that, that the hood that you're livin' <br>Engineered social condition that breeds crime by design <br>Where do you think you get your nine <br>You can say that they're just black <br>But I like to deal with facts <br>In the 1920s you would've found in America <br>Black towns <br>Prospering centres of economics and education to make you proud <br>But some people couldn't bear that the former slaves would not just lie down <br>So the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground <br>Killin hundreds <br>If it ain't understood <br>You think you were always livin' in the hood <br>Shit it's only been sixty years <br>Since they hung blacks and burned em' <br>And that was so cool <br>Day reel passes, picnic baskets <br>Even gave kids the day off school <br>To go see a lynchin' <br>Have a picnic <br>It's fun to watch the little monkeys die <br>Then people act a little dysfunctional <br>You wanna pretend that you don't know why <br>If your colour means you can be killed <br>And you're powerless to get justice about it <br>Is it difficult to figure out how you would then end up feelin' about it <br>And that ain't excuses <br>Just dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality <br>Where a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually <br>That's America <br>This Britain <br>Some things are similar <br>Some different <br>In this country the first enslaved were the working class <br>What's changed <br>Worse jobs, worse conditions <br>Worse taxes, look where you're livin' <br>You go to the pub, Friday night <br>You will fight with a guy <br>Don't know what for <br>But won't fight with a guy, suit and a tie <br>Who sends your kids to die in a war <br>They don't send the kids of the richer politicians <br>It's your kids, the poor British <br>That they send to go die in a foreign land <br>For these wars you don't understand <br>Yeah they say that you're British <br>And that lovely patriotism they feed ya <br>But in reality you have more in common with immigrants <br>Than with your leaders <br>I know, both side of my family <br>Black and white are fed ghetto mentality <br>Reality in this system <br>Poor people are dirt regardless of shade <br>But with that said <br>Let's not pretend that everything is the same <br>When our grandparents came here to Britain <br>If you had a criminal record you couldn't get in <br>Yet that ain't protect them from all the stupid, stupid abuses they would be livin' <br>Kicked in the teeth <br>Stabbed in the street <br>Many times fired bombed our houses <br>Put faeces through our letter box <br>And of course the cops did so much about it <br>Daily, up to the 80s <br>People spittin' into my pram cos' I was a coon baby <br>But of course that has had no effect on why today we are crazy <br>And none of this was for any good reason <br>They were just dark and breathing <br>To ease the guilt now for all of this treatment <br>Constant stereotypes are needed <br>So if I celebrate how big that my dick is <br>Bricks that I'm flippin' <br>Clips that I'm stickin' <br>Chicks that I'm hittin' <br>I'm playing my position <br>But if I teach a kid to be a mathematician <br>Messin' with the schism <br>How they gonna fill a prison when materialism is nothing but a religion <br>What do you think we got now in Britain <br>Just like America, private prisons <br>Prisons for profit <br>That mean when your kids go jail people make money off it <br>So keep environments that breed crime <br>Build more jails at the same time <br>Market badness to the kids in the rhymes <br>As long as rich kids ain't dying its fine <br>Get em' to the point where some are so lost <br>They actually believe that if they don't celebrate killin' themselves off <br>That it's because they're soft <br>Was Malcolm soft <br>Was Marley soft <br>Tell me was Marcus Garvey soft <br>Well Was Mohammed Ali soft <br>Nah, Nah I think not <br>But they want us to think that the road is cool <br>Being on road is all we can do <br>We don't control the wholesale productions <br>Who benefits from us movin' the food <br>Or thinking there's no way out of road life <br>But Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside <br>When Marcus Garvey organised more than 6 million people <br>With no Facebook or Twitter <br>Why is this something you cannot equal <br>Shiiiiit <br>One of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard <br>Now what's he doing <br>Passin' his doctorate <br>Don't tell me that it's too hard <br>Who trained you to believe that you're inferior <br>Sungbo Eredo in Nigeria are the remains of an ancient moat <br>Dug 1000 years ago <br>20 metres wide, 70 down <br>Round the remains of an ancient town <br>That's 400 square miles around <br>400 square miles around <br>Please, please don't believe me <br>It was a documentary on BBC <br>But we ain't studyin' history <br>Too busy watching MTV <br>And MTV said wear platinum <br>Now everybody wanna go and wear platinum <br>And MTV said pop magnums <br>Now everybody wanna go and pop magnums <br>If MTV said drink prune juice <br>You would start hearing that in tunes soon <br>'Hey Today I wore my Cartier <br>Is it now more important what I got to say' <br>Oh and I drive a Mercedes by the way <br>So everybody listen to what I got to say <br>Huh, does that make you all happy <br>Ahh but shit my head's still nappy <br>Think for myself, still some mad at me <br>But on the mic ain't not one bad as me <br>All of this here's good for the rhymes <br>Put us in the same place at the same time <br>And it's clear to everybody that I'm out of my mind <br>Some of these guys are runnin' out of their rhymes <br>Clear to everybody that has got ears <br>I'm the guy that they just might fear <br>They wanna get near but they can't have a peer <br>Ah dear I'm hard liquor you're just like beer <br>Front on the kid for another five years <br>Come to my shows and some cry tears <br>It mean that much to em', it's a movement <br>I don't speak for myself but a unit <br>Black, white, man, woman, anyone that respects truth we put in <br>Dudes are like no dinner with just puddin' <br>Yeah you're sweet but no substance puddin' <br>You could never ever be with a level on <br>Our songs get out played out there in Lebanon <br>We speak for the people properly <br>Not for the old fat guys in offices <br>And the girls love him, it ain't fair <br>He can't even be bothered to comb his hair <br>Anyway that's enough kissin' my own arse <br>Back to the more important task of being so shower <br>I got half the hood screaming “KNOWLEDGE IS POWER” <br>And I ain't saying that will change rap <br>But I do know this for a fact <br>Right now there's a yout' on your block <br>With his hands on his balls, face screwed up <br>Swear he don't care, don't give a fuck <br>That he won't let nobody caught his block <br>But the words go in <br>Open up your chakra <br>Because once that's happened there's no going back <br>Once you start to see what is really happening <br>Who the enemy you should be attackin' is <br>So READ, READ, READ <br>Stuck on the block, READ, READ <br>Sittin' in the box, READ, READ <br>Don't let them say what you can achieve <br>Cos when people are enslaved <br>One of the first things they do is stop them reading <br>Cos' it is well understood that intelligent people will take their freedom <br>Cos' if we knew our power we would understand that we can't be held down <br>If we knew our power, we would not elevate not one of these clowns <br>If we knew our power, we wouldn't get arrogant when we get two pennies <br>If we knew our power, we would see what everybody sees, that we're rich already <br>But never mind MCs go run for your mummy <br>I'm hungry, I run for my tummy <br>That's enough, back to worshiping money <br>I'm off, back to the study
