</script><br> Once upon a time in an obscure part of the Milky Way Galaxy <br>there was a spinning ball of water and rock ruled by the forces of evil <br>The Devil himself, proud of the magnificent achievements of his children <br>decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land <br>He sent invites to thousands of the greatest murders <br>rapists and general assorted scum <br>inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon <br>Each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim as the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet <br>and the Devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king <br>After many days of deliberating, all of the petty thieves <br>such as street criminals <br>have been found far short of the required level of wickedness <br>and there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition <br>They were the monarchs of empire, a cartel of bankers <br>the heads of religious orders, and the third world dictators <br>Each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the Devil <br>We have recorded these events for posterity <br><br>Uh, listen <br>Uh, okay, yo <br>First up was the thief of the worst reputation <br>Dictator of a third world nation <br>He looked the Devil in the eye as he spoke <br>In an oh so serious tone <br><br>Dear Mr Devil <br>I am the greatest thief there has ever been on Earth <br>Please tell me who else more than me personifies your work <br>I came to power in a military coup, I murdered the elected president <br>He wanted to use the resources of our country for our peoples' benefit <br>I proved to masters in the west <br>I could kill my own people just as well as the best <br>So I took over the so called independent country when the foreigners left <br>Sent squads of death to those who would suggest <br>In power should be the one they elect <br>Erected a statue of the great man <br>That raped our mothers, stole our lands <br>That's how little self respect I have <br>Don't fight slavery, it makes me glad <br>Account in Switzerland, Rolls Royce <br>Murder and rape cos I want new toys <br>Don't want a portion, but a whole fortune <br>With that profit, what's a little bit of torture <br>Even outlawed my indigenous culture <br>And language and history <br>And taught our people to only worship colonizers <br>And of course, ME <br><br>Thief <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>Come and dine with me <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>The banquet of the thieves <br><br>The Devil was so impressed with this wonderful man <br>He almost ejaculated on his hands <br>But the monarch of the empire said <br><br>Excuse me, Mr Devil, I'd like to speak if I may <br>Who do you think trained this amateur dictator to behave this way <br>Yeah, I'm sure before I came along his country was far from heaven <br>But look of the carnage I caused all over the Earth, it's got to be the work of the Devil <br>Countless deaths, mass enslavement <br>Deliberate starvation of whole nations <br>The dictator tries his best, but looking at me, he's just an imitation <br>Who do you think pays his wages <br>He would love to be trading places <br>I've been doing this ting on the roads <br>Way back, way back, way back <br>Since the Middle Ages <br>Everybody knows he's a criminal element <br>They think I'm democratic and benevolent <br>And that shows that I'm really devilish <br>Cos people think I'm heaven sent <br>I couldn't care about democracy <br>You all know no one elected me <br>The people love me despite my crimes <br>Sucka MCs wanna bite my shine <br>So blingin' out of control you would vomit <br>Don't even touch dough, but my face is on it <br><br>Thief <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>Come and dine with me <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>The banquet of the thieves <br><br>I'm a pervert who's in the cloak of the clergy <br>Yes, I'm a pervert who's in the cloak <br>I'm a despicable character <br>I use my position of authority and spiritual reverence <br>I'm a despicable character <br><br>Mr Devil, allow me to speak <br>For all of the religious leaders that leech <br>In the world of creeps, I'm initiated <br>I take the peoples' faith and dissipate it <br>With false promises, hollow oratory <br>Don't need a gun, it's daylight robbery <br>Dear Mr Devil <br>I thought you would like it <br>How I use their faith in God to keep them blinded <br>Put on a nice voice, read them a book <br>And they believe that I am not a crook <br>Tell them God will repay them in the next <br>They give me their life savings so I can buy jets <br>All the reports about child sex <br>None of us have ever gone to jail yet <br>This system of stealing, so appealing <br>Convinces the victims their lives have meaning <br>Monarchs boast about conquest <br>But needed my blessings to get it done <br>And all of the dictators use my books <br>Therefore, they are just my sons <br><br>The Devil was sure this was the winner <br>And was just about to put an end to the dinner <br>But then the man from the banking cartel <br>Stepped up and said <br><br>I think I'm the biggest sinner <br>All of those three depend on me <br>All they ever do is defending me <br>Cos I paid for all of the things they have <br>Of course, and all of the lives they lead <br>Paid for the guns, bombs and the tanks <br>That's why you see, there is always more <br>I turned science's basic appliance <br>Into a client of weapon and war <br>Paid for monarchies, armed robberies <br>I make monopolies out of property <br>Never shot a gun nor killed anyone myself <br>But billions die cos of me <br>Who needs a threat I make a debt <br>Out of thin air, just sit back and collect <br>Every single day, whatever they say <br>The people need me just to connect it <br>Yet none of them knows what I look like <br>Yet all of them spend my money to look nice <br>They want more, no one's pure <br>I hold the keys to every single door <br>Sell sex and drugs, profit and lies <br>Earth and skies, I'll even sell life <br>I'll even sell freedom for the right price <br>But no one is smart enough to ask me nice <br>So Mr Devil, give me the medal <br>Don't be biased <br>If you don't give it to me <br>I'll just BUY IT <br><br>Thief <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>Come and dine with me <br>It's the banquet of the thieves <br>The banquet of the thieves </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>10 Years Of Akala</td></tr><tr><th
