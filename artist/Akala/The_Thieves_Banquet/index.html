</script> <p>Once upon a time in an obscure part of the Milky Way Galaxy</br>there was a spinning ball of water and rock ruled by the forces of evil</br>The Devil himself, proud of the magnificent achievements of his children</br>decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land</br>He sent invites to thousands of the greatest murders</br>rapists and general assorted scum</br>inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon</br>Each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim as the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet</br>and the Devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king</br>After many days of deliberating, all of the petty thieves</br>such as street criminals</br>have been found far short of the required level of wickedness</br>and there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition</br>They were the monarchs of empire, a cartel of bankers</br>the heads of religious orders, and the third world dictators</br>Each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the Devil</br>We have recorded these events for posterity</br>Uh, listen</br>Uh, okay, yo</br>First up was the thief of the worst reputation</br>Dictator of a third world nation</br>He looked the Devil in the eye as he spoke</br>In an oh so serious tone</br>Dear Mr Devil</br>I am the greatest thief there has ever been on Earth</br>Please tell me who else more than me personifies your work</br>I came to power in a military coup, I murdered the elected president</br>He wanted to use the resources of our country for our peoples' benefit</br>I proved to masters in the west</br>I could kill my own people just as well as the best</br>So I took over the so called independent country when the foreigners left</br>Sent squads of death to those who would suggest</br>In power should be the one they elect</br>Erected a statue of the great man</br>That raped our mothers, stole our lands</br>That's how little self respect I have</br>Don't fight slavery, it makes me glad</br>Account in Switzerland, Rolls Royce</br>Murder and rape cos I want new toys</br>Don't want a portion, but a whole fortune</br>With that profit, what's a little bit of torture</br>Even outlawed my indigenous culture</br>And language and history</br>And taught our people to only worship colonizers</br>And of course, ME</br>Thief</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>Come and dine with me</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>The banquet of the thieves</br>The Devil was so impressed with this wonderful man</br>He almost ejaculated on his hands</br>But the monarch of the empire said</br>Excuse me, Mr Devil, I'd like to speak if I may</br>Who do you think trained this amateur dictator to behave this way</br>Yeah, I'm sure before I came along his country was far from heaven</br>But look of the carnage I caused all over the Earth, it's got to be the work of the Devil</br>Countless deaths, mass enslavement</br>Deliberate starvation of whole nations</br>The dictator tries his best, but looking at me, he's just an imitation</br>Who do you think pays his wages</br>He would love to be trading places</br>I've been doing this ting on the roads</br>Way back, way back, way back</br>Since the Middle Ages</br>Everybody knows he's a criminal element</br>They think I'm democratic and benevolent</br>And that shows that I'm really devilish</br>Cos people think I'm heaven sent</br>I couldn't care about democracy</br>You all know no one elected me</br>The people love me despite my crimes</br>Sucka MCs wanna bite my shine</br>So blingin' out of control you would vomit</br>Don't even touch dough, but my face is on it</br>Thief</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>Come and dine with me</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>The banquet of the thieves</br>I'm a pervert who's in the cloak of the clergy</br>Yes, I'm a pervert who's in the cloak</br>I'm a despicable character</br>I use my position of authority and spiritual reverence</br>I'm a despicable character</br>Mr Devil, allow me to speak</br>For all of the religious leaders that leech</br>In the world of creeps, I'm initiated</br>I take the peoples' faith and dissipate it</br>With false promises, hollow oratory</br>Don't need a gun, it's daylight robbery</br>Dear Mr Devil</br>I thought you would like it</br>How I use their faith in God to keep them blinded</br>Put on a nice voice, read them a book</br>And they believe that I am not a crook</br>Tell them God will repay them in the next</br>They give me their life savings so I can buy jets</br>All the reports about child sex</br>None of us have ever gone to jail yet</br>This system of stealing, so appealing</br>Convinces the victims their lives have meaning</br>Monarchs boast about conquest</br>But needed my blessings to get it done</br>And all of the dictators use my books</br>Therefore, they are just my sons</br>The Devil was sure this was the winner</br>And was just about to put an end to the dinner</br>But then the man from the banking cartel</br>Stepped up and said</br>I think I'm the biggest sinner</br>All of those three depend on me</br>All they ever do is defending me</br>Cos I paid for all of the things they have</br>Of course, and all of the lives they lead</br>Paid for the guns, bombs and the tanks</br>That's why you see, there is always more</br>I turned science's basic appliance</br>Into a client of weapon and war</br>Paid for monarchies, armed robberies</br>I make monopolies out of property</br>Never shot a gun nor killed anyone myself</br>But billions die cos of me</br>Who needs a threat I make a debt</br>Out of thin air, just sit back and collect</br>Every single day, whatever they say</br>The people need me just to connect it</br>Yet none of them knows what I look like</br>Yet all of them spend my money to look nice</br>They want more, no one's pure</br>I hold the keys to every single door</br>Sell sex and drugs, profit and lies</br>Earth and skies, I'll even sell life</br>I'll even sell freedom for the right price</br>But no one is smart enough to ask me nice</br>So Mr Devil, give me the medal</br>Don't be biased</br>If you don't give it to me</br>I'll just BUY IT</br>Thief</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>Come and dine with me</br>It's the banquet of the thieves</br>The
