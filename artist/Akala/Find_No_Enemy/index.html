</script><br> Apparently I'm second generation black Caribbean <br>And half white Scottish whatever that means <br>See lately I feel confused with the boxes <br>Cause to me all they do is breed conflict <br>It's not that I've lost touch with the reality <br>Racism, sexism and nationality <br>Just to me it all seems like insanity <br>Why must I rob you of your humanity <br>To feel good about mine <br>It's all about crime <br>Dehumanizing is how I justify it <br>So I must keep on lying about the history of Africa <br>So I can live the with massacres <br>And repeat my mantra of Muslim and terrorist <br>So I can sleep at night as bombs take flight <br>Eyes wide but I'm blind to the sight <br>Too busy chasing the perfect life <br>And the working class keep them uneducated <br>Truly educated men could never be racist <br>To educate is to draw out what is within <br>Are we not all not the same under the skin <br>I got a heart like yours that pumps blood and oxygen <br>And insecurities are a whole lot of them I'm scared like you deep down <br>I really do care that world is not fair like you <br>But I don't even believe my own prayers like you <br>Chasing career going nowhere like you <br>Lost in a fog of my own insecurities <br>I hold myself up as a image of purity <br>And I judge everybody else <br>By the color of their skin or the size of their wealth <br>But it's not good for my health <br>As the only one I ever really judge is myself <br>The oppressor must suffer like the oppressed <br>Though I pretend I'm in control of this mess <br>By inflating my ego, puffing my chest <br>I see my weakness, and need to show strength <br>Or what we think strong is because if we're honest <br>True strength is the strength to be honest <br>And if I'm honest I am just tired <br>If I'm honest I am just tired <br>Tired of everyday filling up my car and knowing that <br>I'm paying for the bombs in Iraq <br>Tired of pretending like it don't hurt my heart <br>Of wanting change but not knowing where to start <br>Tired of listening to all the conditioning <br>And all the forms they have me filling in <br>Next time you see what is a thug and despise him <br>Please know I was just like him <br>Cause I was like eight the first time I saw crack <br>Same time I first smoked weed choking on blowbacks <br>First time I saw knifes penetrate flesh <br>It was meat cleavers to the back of the head <br>As I grew and teenage years passed <br>Many more knifes pierced and the shots blast <br>And I not saying I had the worst upbringing <br>But there's a million young men just like me in prison <br>We complain about racism and elevate clowns <br>With their trousers down swinging their dicks round <br>Maybe that is not quite literal <br>But everything they do is just as stereotypical <br>To my real fans I feel your pain <br>And I get the messages, but don't complain <br>That we ain't got more fame for paying our part <br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts <br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts <br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts <br>Calling it black radio, don't make laugh <br>So is black music all about tits and arse <br>You don't represent nothing, you're just pretending <br>When was the last time you ever played Hendrix <br>Or Miles Davis or John Coltrane <br>Or Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday <br>We can call it urban to me that's cool <br>If urban means street, that includes jazz too <br>And rock for that matter <br>Go ask Mick Jagger or Jimmy Page what they were listening to the blues <br>Not discrediting, love Zeppelin too, just giving credit where credit is due <br>That blood soaked word rappers still use <br>All it really shows is that we still self abuse <br>That was the word that was used to kill Kelso Cochrane and Emmett Till <br>That was the word that the conscience eased <br>And made people pleased to hung you from trees <br>That was the word that let the whips crack <br>No matter what you say you can't take it back <br>And I can say their black so I feel their pain easier <br>But 1915 look at Armenia <br>If the whole world is human stupidity <br>Though we choke ourselves to death quite literally <br>And I can talk with my comfortable mouth <br>With my comfortable clothes and my comfortable house <br>The tables will turn, we can but stall them <br>Every empire on this earth has fallen <br>So unless we can find another way <br>Maybe not today, but it will come one day <br>It may sound like I'm bitter but in fact truth be told I am quite the opposite <br>I wake everyday and am overwhelmed <br>Just to be alive and be like no one else <br>And the sheer weight of the thought of space <br>Is enough to keep my little ego in place <br>All that we chase and try to replace all along it was right in our face <br>The only way we can ever change anything <br>Is to look in the mirror and find no enemy <br>The only way we can ever change anything <br>Look in the mirror and find no enemy </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>10 Years Of Akala</td></tr><tr><th
