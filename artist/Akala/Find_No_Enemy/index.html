</script> <p>Apparently I'm second generation black Caribbean</br>And half white Scottish whatever that means</br>See lately I feel confused with the boxes</br>Cause to me all they do is breed conflict</br>It's not that I've lost touch with the reality</br>Racism, sexism and nationality</br>Just to me it all seems like insanity</br>Why must I rob you of your humanity</br>To feel good about mine</br>It's all about crime</br>Dehumanizing is how I justify it</br>So I must keep on lying about the history of Africa</br>So I can live the with massacres</br>And repeat my mantra of Muslim and terrorist</br>So I can sleep at night as bombs take flight</br>Eyes wide but I'm blind to the sight</br>Too busy chasing the perfect life</br>And the working class keep them uneducated</br>Truly educated men could never be racist</br>To educate is to draw out what is within</br>Are we not all not the same under the skin</br>I got a heart like yours that pumps blood and oxygen</br>And insecurities are a whole lot of them I'm scared like you deep down</br>I really do care that world is not fair like you</br>But I don't even believe my own prayers like you</br>Chasing career going nowhere like you</br>Lost in a fog of my own insecurities</br>I hold myself up as a image of purity</br>And I judge everybody else</br>By the color of their skin or the size of their wealth</br>But it's not good for my health</br>As the only one I ever really judge is myself</br>The oppressor must suffer like the oppressed</br>Though I pretend I'm in control of this mess</br>By inflating my ego, puffing my chest</br>I see my weakness, and need to show strength</br>Or what we think strong is because if we're honest</br>True strength is the strength to be honest</br>And if I'm honest I am just tired</br>If I'm honest I am just tired</br>Tired of everyday filling up my car and knowing that</br>I'm paying for the bombs in Iraq</br>Tired of pretending like it don't hurt my heart</br>Of wanting change but not knowing where to start</br>Tired of listening to all the conditioning</br>And all the forms they have me filling in</br>Next time you see what is a thug and despise him</br>Please know I was just like him</br>Cause I was like eight the first time I saw crack</br>Same time I first smoked weed choking on blowbacks</br>First time I saw knifes penetrate flesh</br>It was meat cleavers to the back of the head</br>As I grew and teenage years passed</br>Many more knifes pierced and the shots blast</br>And I not saying I had the worst upbringing</br>But there's a million young men just like me in prison</br>We complain about racism and elevate clowns</br>With their trousers down swinging their dicks round</br>Maybe that is not quite literal</br>But everything they do is just as stereotypical</br>To my real fans I feel your pain</br>And I get the messages, but don't complain</br>That we ain't got more fame for paying our part</br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts</br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts</br>They can keep the charts all I want is your hearts</br>Calling it black radio, don't make laugh</br>So is black music all about tits and arse</br>You don't represent nothing, you're just pretending</br>When was the last time you ever played Hendrix</br>Or Miles Davis or John Coltrane</br>Or Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday</br>We can call it urban to me that's cool</br>If urban means street, that includes jazz too</br>And rock for that matter</br>Go ask Mick Jagger or Jimmy Page what they were listening to the blues</br>Not discrediting, love Zeppelin too, just giving credit where credit is due</br>That blood soaked word rappers still use</br>All it really shows is that we still self abuse</br>That was the word that was used to kill Kelso Cochrane and Emmett Till</br>That was the word that the conscience eased</br>And made people pleased to hung you from trees</br>That was the word that let the whips crack</br>No matter what you say you can't take it back</br>And I can say their black so I feel their pain easier</br>But 1915 look at Armenia</br>If the whole world is human stupidity</br>Though we choke ourselves to death quite literally</br>And I can talk with my comfortable mouth</br>With my comfortable clothes and my comfortable house</br>The tables will turn, we can but stall them</br>Every empire on this earth has fallen</br>So unless we can find another way</br>Maybe not today, but it will come one day</br>It may sound like I'm bitter but in fact truth be told I am quite the opposite</br>I wake everyday and am overwhelmed</br>Just to be alive and be like no one else</br>And the sheer weight of the thought of space</br>Is enough to keep my little ego in place</br>All that we chase and try to replace all along it was right in our face</br>The only way we can ever change anything</br>Is to look in the mirror and find no enemy</br>The only way we can ever change anything</br>Look in the mirror and find no enemy<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : 10 Years Of Akala</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-03-02</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap /
