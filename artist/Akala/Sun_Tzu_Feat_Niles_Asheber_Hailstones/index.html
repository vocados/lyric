you like Sun Tzu</br>The art of fighting without fighting</br>Or fighting when you need to</br>It's appealing, we're peaceful but demons if we need to</br>Equal whatever you bring we'll meet you</br>This sport is a war with a discourse</br>Which thoroughbred horse make it through this course</br>Which emcee shall I chew up for this course</br>Same energy known for the sick tours</br>No hype man, breath control</br>Record a track I do the same thing live</br>Can't do that Ah bless your soul</br>You ain't ready for the Shaolin vibes</br>Wake up when it's still dark in the sky</br>With the heart for the grind and an art full of rhymes</br>And the sharpest of lines and a spark of the mind</br>So bright that I'm leaving them partially blind</br>Any which way some of you want to come

been studying the art of war</br>It's the hardest of times we're living in, isn't it</br>So why ain't you disciplined just a little bit</br>Little git, wanna throw a little hissy fit</br>Here's a question, tell me can you riddle it</br>Does it take effort to make yourself really shit</br>Or is that your best that you're giving it</br>Nah, it can't be</br>Well, rhyming just ain't for everyone</br>Now every little son of a gun seems to think</br>From the moment they come out their mum they are the one</br>Without ever having what it takes to become</br>Ten lifetimes ain't enough</br>I was a griot, I was a Sufi</br>I was a Mayan priest but not in the movies</br>I was a druid pouring out fluid</br>Blessing the ancestors cos we come through them</br>Hundred more times I was born before</br>Before The Windrush came and Britain forever changed</br>Energy and memory it remains</br>In my veins and it don't take much to reclaim</br>All I gotta do is say my own name</br>And the power of Greyskull reigns</br>Yes, ruthless student, nuisance mutant</br>Trains with the Shaolin monks, I'm reclusive</br>Name is a thousand thumps with a pool stick</br>That reigns on a silly little punk for the bullshit</br>Game for a round, punch and we all kick</br>Elbows, knees, let's go for the full kit</br>Tell your G's I'll believe that they're all sick</br>When I see

war</br>It's the art of a warrior, heart of a foreigner</br>That's living in an all white town from a toddler</br>Graft that your body does half wanna honour us</br>But you've gotta tell them that you're past wanting followers</br>A class for the coroners, who the ras wanna collar us</br>Kill rate way past choleras</br>Look at all the revellers, look at what a rebel does</br>Sekkle, metal can't settle us</br>Dope, but the CIA can't peddle us</br>Nope, we go for the throat what you telling us</br>Choke, on the little hope that you're selling us</br>Joke, I take Britain like Severus</br>Cult, it's the occult and its elements</br>They wanna reign high but we come to be levelers</br>We know the design and we're done with the evidence</br>Go with the times get bun for the hell of it</br>Any
