</script> <p>Murder, murder 8x</br>Every shot that thunders</br>Through the nighttime don't you wonder</br>What potential was extinguished</br>To keep the flames burning under</br>Through the underworld and over world</br>Principles are so the same</br>Though we pretend they're not as if they do not control cocaine</br>But you'll find it's connected</br>Every kid in the hood that's living with a death wish</br>Is the same as the King who kills for the bling</br>But he is just much more reckless</br>It's the King that I'm talking about</br>Though he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth</br>He still gonna clap for the slightest of chat</br>At any world leader that can't back it</br>If he is sitting on the boxes</br>They are just oil or mineral deposits</br>Food he is moving fucking with our profit</br>So he better stop it</br>They say money makes the world go round, but it don't</br>That is just not true</br>If you ain't got guns to protect that money</br>I'lI regret that, Sonny, it is more fool you</br>Only murder further agendas that money couldn't force</br>Eliminate the foes who propose</br>To suppose a different course, of course</br>A little torture is usually a big supporter</br>Though there's nothing quite like killing</br>Good riddance to non supporters</br>We demonize the man on the corner</br>Paint him as a thug</br>We worship murder so much</br>It's just that he ain't killed enough</br>You wanna commit murder</br>But not end up in cuffs</br>You gotta make it to the Premier League</br>A thousand murders plus</br>Who said money makes the world go 'round</br>They just didn't know</br>Murder runs the globe</br>M m murder runs the globe</br>Every knife that puncture lungs of sons</br>Don't make you wonder Mums</br>If he was born to billionaires backed by a hundred guns</br>Would he be living still, drinking, sleeping, eating meals</br>Instead of dead where it don't count</br>We expect you to be killed</br>Because living as a pauper is a fate that is tainted</br>Acquainted with torture</br>We ain't debating the rape of the daughter</br>If she was raised in particular borders</br>Place that fate made particular slaughters</br>No fate just particular orders</br>It's the way of the world no accident</br>In fact it's immaculate</br>You got a big gun start clapping it</br>Cause the language of power devour quick</br>Any silly biddy little pacifist or activist or challenges</br>Brown or black skin savages</br>Who inhabiting land with minerals in it</br>Who think for a minute that the rhetoric we spoke</br>Hope Was not meant to be a joke</br>Don't dream compassion will happen it won't</br>Just go straight for the throat</br>Because any nation or races</br>That prove themselves incapable</br>Of matching modern murder machines</br>Make themselves enslavable</br>It is murder not money we desire insatiable</br>The thrilling of the killing it's million dollars sensational, YES</br>What you can't do with a bribe</br>Can be achieved in a breeze with a gun and a knife</br>Because only murder further agendas that money couldn't grind</br>Nothing like a couple dead kids to change a parents' mind</br>Who said money makes the world go 'round</br>They just didn't know</br>Murder runs the globe</br>M m murder runs the globe</br>Let's get a little clarity</br>You ain't got the capacity to internationally</br>Have a say in the ways things happening</br>You expect to collect more battering</br>Your arsenal it ain't got no nukes</br>Armies equipped with too few troops</br>We're laughing at you when you call truce</br>It's part of the ritual to shoot shoot shoot</br>You got no background in colonization</br>Or public resource privatization</br>You can't bang with the big boys, face it</br>But you still wanna play like Satan</br>You got no death squads to call your own</br>Or a pilot to fly your drones</br>Much less bulldozers for their homes</br>Talk gangster and you want to name Al Capone</br>He was an amateur, silly little boys don't understand</br>Even he went jail for tax evasion</br>For missing a payment in the payment plan</br>To the man, one with invisible hand</br>And a hidden fist to enforce my plan</br>I am just because I can more wicked than the Summer of Sam</br>Kick your shit and I kick mine fam</br>You bust your gun and I bomb your land</br>Only murder further agendas that money can't control</br>Nothing like a massacred village to get the problem solved</br>Who said money makes the world go 'round</br>They just didn't know</br>Murder runs the globe</br>M m murder runs the globe<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : 10 Years Of Akala</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-03-02</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap /
