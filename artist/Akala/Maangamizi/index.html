</script><br> How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br><br>Maangamizi, meaning African hellacaust <br>Because we paid a hell of a cost <br>And don't really know what was lost <br>And the process ain't ever stopped <br>Since black civilization dropped <br>Through internal greed and external plot <br>Same ones that taught the Ancient Greeks <br>Greece and Rome helped to bring to their knees <br>Then Islam spread across Northern Africa <br>With slavery and massacres <br>Too many hurt, refused to convert <br>Spread South and West and people dispersed <br>Christianity is not alone in using <br>Race and religion for power to expand <br>Desert caravans took slaves across Sand <br>Where they staged a revolt of the Zanj <br>Enemies always invented mythologies <br>Curse of ham, so called prophecy <br>After the migration <br>There was some reinstatement of autonomous nations <br>Then floating on the waves of the seas <br>Came a plague, a genocidal disease <br>With arms and heads, they looked like men <br>Really they were just dogs on two legs <br>When they first came some of our people said Go <br>Most welcomed them into our homes <br>We didn't know they had hearts of stone <br>Frozen by Western Europe's cold <br>Also, there were scumbags among us <br>Willing to work for white conquerors honours <br>And with that collaboration <br>Began the largest forced migration <br>In the history of nations <br><br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br><br>How many millions dead at the bottom of the ocean <br>Thrown overboard like property stolen <br>Or jumped overboard rather than be sold on <br>A mother with her baby in arms, hold on <br>What awaited was not just enslavement <br>But a genocidal impulse craving <br>They committed unspeakable abuses <br>To make a nigga from an African human <br>Took a woman ready to give birth <br>Tied her limbs to four posts held firm <br>In a main square made every slave watch <br>Covered her in raw meat <br>Let off a pack of dogs <br>If anyone watching, even a relative <br>Made a sound, kill them for the hell of it <br>This was every day, not the exception <br>The science of gynaecology was perfected <br>On black women, no anaesthetic <br>They said a nigga bitch couldn't feel pain, pathetic <br>Hang a man from a tree cut off his penis <br>Force people to eat their own faeces <br>Put people in zoos, in a cage <br>Chimpanzee, black human, ape <br>And it was upon this here atrocity <br>Europe became the dominant economy <br>Now they play games, pretend it's about names <br>It's a scheme for unequal trade <br>Imagine the largest companies today <br>If all of their employees got no pay <br>For all of the centuries profit was made <br>Black skin was always branded slave <br>Even the child of the masters rape <br>Could be killed or sold because black blood in her veins <br>But the ancestors fought back, got free <br>Probably have not heard of Jean Jacque Dessalines <br>Probably don't know the Haitian revolution <br>Caused the French to sell half of America <br>Nor know the role that Africans played <br>In the Civil War for that same America <br>If you ain't heard of Nanny of the Maroons or Bogle <br>You probably believe what they told you <br>But if they set Africans free <br>Because all of a sudden they grow a conscience <br>Tell me this <br>Why were the slave masters given compensation <br>And those that suffered not given a thing <br>Why did they then invade Africa <br>And make Africans slaves in their home <br>With the Belgians killing 10 million <br>Souls in the Congo alone <br>Why then Jim Crow <br>Why Apartheid <br>Why did Black Wall Street burn that night <br>Why collaborators will work for such evil <br>Willing to be tools against their own people <br>Why Africom <br>Imperialism for the new age <br>But with a brown face on it <br>That's right imperialism for the new age <br>But with a brown face on it <br><br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi <br><br>Some will try their best to justify this torture <br>By asking you who the slaves were brought from <br>As if we do not know, tell them Get the hell out <br>Every genocide ever has had sell outs <br>And the largest wars of humans <br>Were fought between the people of Western Europe <br>So by your rationale it's cool to kill Frenchman <br>They killed Germans that look like them <br>Absurd right But when your skin is white <br>Different set of rules you can abide by <br>Dark suffering is not humanized <br>No surprise, we still see ourselves through their eyes <br>Darkies became legally human <br>During the course of our parents life <br>And the freedoms we have only occurred <br>Cos our ancestors spilled their blood to the earth <br>They changed that much Are you so sure <br>The world's darker people still the most poor <br>So it's our task to put an end to this <br>Even those like me with our heritage mixed <br>If a knife is in your back 9 inches <br>And it's only been pulled out six <br>When the wound starts healing <br>And we stop bleeding and bleaching <br>Can it begin to fix <br>When the plague of self hate <br>Is no longer a weight so great <br>Push you to kill one another <br>When we put a stop to false charity <br>That gives with one hand and bombs with the other <br>When the IMF and World Bank, along with their puppets <br>No longer strangle our nations <br>When the invaders don't have military bases <br>In so many places <br>When the jail cells are not packed with black backs <br>And the gats and the crack are no longer factors <br>When we celebrate true self determination <br>Not a few token bit part actors <br>When the truth is told and there is <br>The dignity to remember the dead <br>Because as long as they are distorting the past <br>It means they have the intention of doing it again <br><br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi <br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD <br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me <br>It's the Maangamizi, It's
