It's the Maangamizi</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>Maangamizi, meaning African hellacaust</br>Because we paid a hell of a cost</br>And don't really know what was lost</br>And the process ain't ever stopped</br>Since black civilization dropped</br>Through internal greed and external plot</br>Same ones that taught the Ancient Greeks</br>Greece and Rome helped to bring to their knees</br>Then Islam spread across Northern Africa</br>With slavery and massacres</br>Too many hurt, refused to convert</br>Spread South and West and people dispersed</br>Christianity is not alone in using</br>Race and religion for power to expand</br>Desert caravans took slaves across Sand</br>Where they staged a revolt of the Zanj</br>Enemies always invented mythologies</br>Curse of ham, so called prophecy</br>After the migration</br>There was some reinstatement of autonomous nations</br>Then floating on the waves of the seas</br>Came a plague, a genocidal disease</br>With arms and heads, they looked like men</br>Really they were just dogs on two legs</br>When they first came some of our people said Go</br>Most welcomed them into our homes</br>We didn't know they had hearts of stone</br>Frozen by Western Europe's cold</br>Also, there were scumbags among us</br>Willing to work for white conquerors honours</br>And with that collaboration</br>Began the largest forced migration</br>In the history of nations</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>How many millions dead at the bottom of the ocean</br>Thrown overboard like property stolen</br>Or jumped overboard rather than be sold on</br>A mother with her baby in arms, hold on</br>What awaited was not just enslavement</br>But a genocidal impulse craving</br>They committed unspeakable abuses</br>To make a nigga from an African human</br>Took a woman ready to give birth</br>Tied her limbs to four posts held firm</br>In a main square made every slave watch</br>Covered her in raw meat</br>Let off a pack of dogs</br>If anyone watching, even a relative</br>Made a sound, kill them for the hell of it</br>This was every day, not the exception</br>The science of gynaecology was perfected</br>On black women, no anaesthetic</br>They said a nigga bitch couldn't feel pain, pathetic</br>Hang a man from a tree cut off his penis</br>Force people to eat their own faeces</br>Put people in zoos, in a cage</br>Chimpanzee, black human, ape</br>And it was upon this here atrocity</br>Europe became the dominant economy</br>Now they play games, pretend it's about names</br>It's a scheme for unequal trade</br>Imagine the largest companies today</br>If all of their employees got no pay</br>For all of the centuries profit was made</br>Black skin was always branded slave</br>Even the child of the masters rape</br>Could be killed or sold because black blood in her veins</br>But the ancestors fought back, got free</br>Probably have not heard of Jean Jacque Dessalines</br>Probably don't know the Haitian revolution</br>Caused the French to sell half of America</br>Nor know the role that Africans played</br>In the Civil War for that same America</br>If you ain't heard of Nanny of the Maroons or Bogle</br>You probably believe what they told you</br>But if they set Africans free</br>Because all of a sudden they grow a conscience</br>Tell me this</br>Why were the slave masters given compensation</br>And those that suffered not given a thing</br>Why did they then invade Africa</br>And make Africans slaves in their home</br>With the Belgians killing 10 million</br>Souls in the Congo alone</br>Why then Jim Crow</br>Why Apartheid</br>Why did Black Wall Street burn that night</br>Why collaborators will work for such evil</br>Willing to be tools against their own people</br>Why Africom</br>Imperialism for the new age</br>But with a brown face on it</br>That's right imperialism for the new age</br>But with a brown face on it</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>Some will try their best to justify this torture</br>By asking you who the slaves were brought from</br>As if we do not know, tell them Get the hell out</br>Every genocide ever has had sell outs</br>And the largest wars of humans</br>Were fought between the people of Western Europe</br>So by your rationale it's cool to kill Frenchman</br>They killed Germans that look like them</br>Absurd right But when your skin is white</br>Different set of rules you can abide by</br>Dark suffering is not humanized</br>No surprise, we still see ourselves through their eyes</br>Darkies became legally human</br>During the course of our parents life</br>And the freedoms we have only occurred</br>Cos our ancestors spilled their blood to the earth</br>They changed that much Are you so sure</br>The world's darker people still the most poor</br>So it's our task to put an end to this</br>Even those like me with our heritage mixed</br>If a knife is in your back 9 inches</br>And it's only been pulled out six</br>When the wound starts healing</br>And we stop bleeding and bleaching</br>Can it begin to fix</br>When the plague of self hate</br>Is no longer a weight so great</br>Push you to kill one another</br>When we put a stop to false charity</br>That gives with one hand and bombs with the other</br>When the IMF and World Bank, along with their puppets</br>No longer strangle our nations</br>When the invaders don't have military bases</br>In so many places</br>When the jail cells are not packed with black backs</br>And the gats and the crack are no longer factors</br>When we celebrate true self determination</br>Not a few token bit part actors</br>When the truth is told and there is</br>The dignity to remember the dead</br>Because as long as they are distorting the past</br>It means they have the intention of doing it again</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you all the truth would you really believe me</br>It's the Maangamizi, It's the Maangamizi</br>How many lives have we lost to the Maangamizi</br>It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD</br>If I told you
