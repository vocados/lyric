</script><br> The faces that greet us, the places that house us The bars that we drink at, the words that we sing to ourselves You keep down your voice, you keep to yourself Your unwanted things that wanted to help So find a place inside and stay there all the time In a place somewhere where a comforting word from a friend could be heard From a mile away, perhaps it's ringing, perhaps the universe sings to us Perhaps everyone you know is slowly drifting towards the dark, apart But for time to burn I would as well I would burn as well and not keep myself in places where my welcome has worn the hole in which I fell I should have been there when you died I shouldn't have to blame myself I took a ride it was the scenic route Astray Little to gain, so much to lose But I didn't know back at that time, back in the time It wasn't mine, my life has changed so much Just bring it back to before Walk away from home, walk away from Hell Walk away from my loneliness, walk away from myself Walk away from here, walk away from Hell Walk away from my loneliness, walk away from myself 'Cause our time we spent was time spent well And I keep holding onto the memories, the memories everlasting, but I lost track of myself back there And if I could find you I'd give you back these wasted days And it took living in a place where no one wanted me at all, feeling lost everyday before I could finally say, I'm here Doesn't mean that I'm never gonna find you But carry on this way, not a chance </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Scenic Route</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2016-11-11</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
