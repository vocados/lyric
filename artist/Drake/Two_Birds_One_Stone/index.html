demons visit me every night</br>To the most high, I'm forever indebted</br>I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'</br>I put it all in the music</br>Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'</br>Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges</br>Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'</br>I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'</br>Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady</br>Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?</br>Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience</br>Between rocks and hard places of all places</br>Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation</br>Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous</br>Please welcome the October fall baby</br>Vaughan Road Academy, star player―my mind's not all there</br>Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer</br>People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares</br>Count it, it's all there, and we all square</br>Quick money, I'm in and out</br>My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out</br>But, shit, look at Dennis now</br>All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out</br>More blessings for Sandy and him, more life</br>My parents never got it right</br>But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike</br>We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change</br>If we do get to do it twice in another life</br>Scared to go to sleep now</br>'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like</br>Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight</br>Tell me how I went and did chin-ups</br>On this shit when I can't see it</br>Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier</br>Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures</br>Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures</br>Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious</br>You just stare at me while you roll Swishers</br>Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya</br>And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er</br>Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man</br>Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy</br>Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it</br>Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"</br>Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it</br>But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest</br>Like I'm some privileged kid</br>That never sat through a prison visit</br>Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon</br>I never worked to get it</br>But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories</br>That's gotta stop, though</br>You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo</br>If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos</br>You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas</br>Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live</br>You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys</br>I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes</br>And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives</br>Can't show us where the cash is</br>Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is</br>Numbers inflated</br>They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"</br>"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."</br>Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative</br>My numbers out of this world</br>No wonder they got me feeling so alienated</br>You were the man on the moon</br>Now you just go through your phases</br>Life of the angry and famous</br>Rap like I know I'm the greatest</br>Then give you tropical flavours</br>Still never been on hiatus</br>You stay xann'd and perk'd up</br>So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it</br>I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis</br>It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces</br>I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places</br>Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy</br>Is you crazy?<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Two Birds, One Stone</h2><h3
