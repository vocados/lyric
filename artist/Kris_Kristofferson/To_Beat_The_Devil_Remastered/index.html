</script><br> A couple of years back, I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio and while he was reciting some poetry to me that he'd written, I saw that he was about a step away from dyin' and I couldn't help but wonder why And the lines of this song occurred to me I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted and he's got him a good woman And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil <br><br>It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row <br>And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold <br>To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul <br>Keep the chilly wind off my guitar <br><br>My thirsty wanted whisky my hungry needed beans <br>But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream <br>So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams <br>I left my pride and stepped inside a bar <br><br>Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern <br>Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor <br>Friendly shadows <br><br>I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar <br>And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar <br>An' he turned and said Come up here boy, and show us what you are <br>I said I'm dry He bought me a beer <br><br>He nodded at my guitar and said It's a tough life, ain't it <br>I just looked at him He said You ain't makin' any money, are you <br>I said You've been readin' my mail <br>He just smiled and said Let me see that guitar <br>I've got something you oughta hear <br>Then he laid it on me <br><br>If you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listen <br>To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear <br>And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about <br>Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care <br><br>There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind <br>Who were crucified for what they tried to show <br>And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time <br>'Cos the truth remains that no one wants to know <br><br>Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before <br>Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door <br>When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor <br>And lonesome was more than a state of mind <br><br>You see, the devil haunts a hungry man <br>If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him <br>I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing <br>Then I stole his song <br><br>And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen <br>To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear <br>And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about <br>Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care <br><br>I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same <br>But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul <br>And if I never have a nickel, I won't ever die ashamed <br>'Cos I don't believe that no one wants to know </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Austin Sessions (Expanded Edition)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-10</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Country</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
