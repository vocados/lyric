</script><br> Ayy, listen <br><br>Drink 'nough beers before the game, what d'ya call that Georgie Best MC <br>Listen, I don't rest MC <br>You man sleep, that's why you're not the best MC <br>You man are part time, never had beef <br>Now you're on the mic like a bulletproof vest MC <br>I'm a double, precious Tek MC <br>Separate heads from necks <br>I was in the shadows, I came to the light with a path <br>Us spitters who wanna be first and never be last <br>I've been ahead of the game, I've been ahead of the craft <br>I wanna laugh <br>Come sailing along like a boss <br>With the flow I'm like rah, what the ras <br>I'm a striker, yo where the pass Get my triple A passes <br>I'm sitting with the stars <br>Listen up, I ain't normal, I'm sicker than my bars <br>Driven myself crazy, I've been in every condo <br>I like to fly by on my black Yamaha, that's winging <br>Some man do the crime and talk but that's singing <br>Not many man have been in the wars that I've been in <br>I can work here but it's not a place that I could live in <br>Getting new money though but I've already made a killing <br>I've already made a scene, I already live a dream <br>And the king's road's lonely, you can't go with him <br>When it's time for a test <br>Man ah man have gotta move swiftly 'cause you don't want a knife in your chest <br>In the hood every day, it's heroin, living like they're dead <br>Made it, now you're lying in your bed <br>It's like yo, has anybody seen my flow right here, cuz <br>Live in your ears like earplugs <br>Keep myself away like rare dubs <br>What makes you so scared I'm sure fear does <br>On the real though, I stand up and face it <br>The levels high in my scene, that's why I embrace it <br>Let me go on and enjoy what I created <br>Man will jump on the stage and go ape shit <br>For years I've been killing it, trust me <br>Swear down, I will never get rusty <br>My lyrics dem will rough up your lyrics like rugby <br>For the work I put in, the fans love me <br><br>This one ain't free but it's the liberty <br>Street divinity <br>Me and Will's tyranny <br>And this one's willing me to rise like Pyrenees peaks and I'm lyrically <br>In the sky and then I'm right through infinity <br>Forever after, Devs be the master <br>Hit 'em with the Carleone ting, Godfather of grime <br>Don't charter to ride through parts of <br>This precinct when it gets darker <br>Don't think you can stand the heat <br>You can't stand this peak <br>I'm like a million and one lightyears way past of an artist's reach <br>Mary, I'm hard to beat <br>Now think deep <br>About this collabo <br>Historical events unravel <br>Like I went Middlesex, I came to Harrow <br>My man said he feel paro <br>Bloody cuffs, heart on my sleeve <br>This shit feels like beef to me <br>When I spit and my arms start swiniging, I'm bringing <br>More raw shit than a Beckton works <br>Smell it and know why Kano writ it <br>Wrote it, fuck me, alright, don't quote it <br>Focus, look, now I'm back and it's hopeless <br>Comparing me with these seeds <br>Too rare a breed of MC and the flow shifts <br>More than once a minute <br>Getting off like Dahmer, I come and I kill it <br>A Dagenham'er strapped with a bunch of lyrics <br>That bang harder, where the fuck's the gimmicks <br>There ain't nada <br>I've got the heart and spirit they can't harbor <br>Silly men pass the limit and then scarper <br>When it comes on top with the urban legend, I get 'em like Carter <br><br>Spitters can't better these levels of terror <br>I leave my brain in my car but my head is together <br>I make a team of dons quit when I'm put under pressure <br>Rate Devlin, why He's a grime treasure <br>In grime, I've lined my catalogue up, prime seller <br>I'm never too far from the hype that I set up <br>I step up like a bredda who's livin' in nice weather <br>At work, puttin' words together with ice letters <br>I spray, make a big tree lean in the road <br>Trees drop on your house to leave them a cold <br>Trees drop on your car, the windows smash <br>Eski brought O2 Indigo back <br>But this whole time, fam, I've been holy in grime <br>Even a first time who don't know me in grime <br>But you love my stage vibe when I'm holding a mic <br>I'm a pro now, bro, I jump over the spike <br><br>Any hardcore fan of grime <br>Go mad when you hear this bang inside <br>I got the keys like pianists, black and white <br>I've been a beast in the scene all my adult life <br>Ever since Will said Hello, hi <br>I was sat in the shadows, high <br>Concocting the maddest vibe <br>With a way less narrow sight <br>Than a Homosapien eye <br>X Ray, make way for my death ray <br>Nikola Tesla reborn to a next stage <br>Technology stole our children <br>The world's in debt and our men are all templates <br>I'll bring ten crates of my best mates <br>Puttin' up my worst and best traits <br>Converse in a verse with dead saints <br>Holy grime, it's a blessed day </p><table class="table table-striped
