for peoples', scratch your temple</br>The last P, well, that's not that simple</br>It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten</br>It's five little letters that are missin' here</br>You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'</br>It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it</br>You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello</br>You get her name and number</br>And then left feelin' real mellow</br>You get home, wait a day</br>She's what you wanna know about, then you call up</br>And it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house</br>It's not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T</br>It's just her boyfriend's at her house</br>Oh, that's why she's scary</br>It's OPP, time other people's what you get it</br>There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it</br>How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at</br>Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co hittin' that</br>Well, if you do, that's

homies</br>Well, for the ladies OPP means somethin' different</br>The first two letters' the same</br>But the last is somethin' different</br>It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest</br>It's another five letter word</br>Rhymin' with cleanness or meanness</br>I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly</br>I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for property</br>Now lady, here comes a kiss</br>Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly</br>Have you ever known a brother</br>Who had another, like, a girl or wife</br>And you just had to stop a toast</br>'Cause he
