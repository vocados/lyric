don't know which is which and whom is whom, they've stolen each other's faces</br>Janet is there with her high hatting hair full of bedroom feathers</br>Janet is known to make dead men groan in any kind of weathers</br>I crawl over to her, I say hey baby, I say hey Janet</br>You are the one, you are the sun and I'm your dutyfull planet</br>But she ain't down with any of that, she's heard that shit before</br>I say ah ha, oh yeah, you're right, cause I see Betty X standing by the door</br>With more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And it's getting strange in here</br>Yeah, it gets stranger every year</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>Now, Betty X is like Betty Y minus that fatal chromosome</br>Her hair is like the wine dark sea, on which sailors come home</br>I say hey baby, I say hey Betty X I lean close up to her throat</br>This light you're carrying is like a lamp, hanging from a distant boat</br>It is my light, said Betty X, Betty X says this light ain't yours</br>And so much wind blew through her words that I went rolling down the hall</br>For more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And it's getting strange in here</br>Yeah, it gets stranger every year</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>I turn another corner, I go down a corridor and I see this guy</br>He must be about 100 foot tall and he only has one eye</br>He asks me for my autograph, I write nobody and then</br>I wrap myself up in my woolly coat and blind him with my pen</br>Cause someone must have put something in my drink, everything getting strange looking</br>Half the people had turned into squealing pigs, the other half were cooking</br>Let me out of here, I cried, and I went pushing past</br>And I saw miss Polly singing with some girls, I cried strap me to the mast</br>For more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And it's getting strange in here</br>Yeah, it gets stranger every year</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>Then a black girl with no clothes on danced across the room</br>We charted the progress of the planets around that boogie wongie moon</br>I called her my nubian princess, I gave her some sweet back bad ass jive</br>I spent the next seven years between her legs pining for my wife</br>But by and by it all went wrong, I felt all washed up on the shore</br>She stared down at me from up in the storm as I sobbed upon the floor</br>For more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And don't it make you feel alone</br>Don't it make you wanna get right on home</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>Here comes Alina with two black eyes, she's given herself a transfusion</br>She's filled herself with panda blood to avoid all the confusion</br>I said the sun rises and falls with you, and various things about love</br>But a rising violence in me cut all my circuits off</br>Well, Alina, she starts screaming, her cheeks are full of psychotropic leaves</br>Her extinction was nearly absolute when she turned her back on me</br>For more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And it's getting strange in here</br>Yeah, it gets stranger every year</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>I bumped bang crash into Deanna hanging pretty in the door frame</br>Alle the horrors which have befallen me, well, Deanna is to blame</br>Every time I see you, babe, you make me feel so all alone</br>And I wept my face into her dress long after she'd gone home</br>With more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And don't it make you feel alone</br>Don't it make you wanna get right back home</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>Don't it make you feel so sad, don't the blood rush to your feet</br>To think that everything you do today, tomorrow is obsolete</br>Technology and women and little children too</br>Don't it make you feel blue Don't it make you feel blue</br>For more news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>And don't it make you feel alone</br>Don't it make you wanna get right back home</br>More news from nowhere</br>More news from nowhere</br>Well, I've gotta say</br>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Lovely Creatures - The Best Of Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds (1984-2014) (Deluxe Edition)</h2><h3
