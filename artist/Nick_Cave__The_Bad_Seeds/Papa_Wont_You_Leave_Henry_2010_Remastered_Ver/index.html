</script> <p>I went out walking the other day</br>The wind hung wet around my neck</br>My head it rung with screams and groans</br>From the night I spent amongst her bones</br>I passed beside the mission house</br>Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend</br>Shrieked and flapped about life after your dead</br>Well, I thought about my friend, Michel</br>How they rolled him in linoleum</br>And shot him in the neck</br>A bloody halo, like a think bubble</br>Circling his head</br>And I bellowed at the firmament</br>Looks like the rains are hear to stay</br>And the rain pissed down upon me</br>And washed me all away</br>Saying</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Well, the road is long</br>And the road is hard</br>And many fall by the side</br>But Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>So there ain't no need to cry</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>Well, the moon it looked exhausted</br>Like something you should pity</br>Spent an age spotted</br>Above the sizzling wires of the city</br>Well, it reminded me of her face</br>Her bleached and hungry eyes</br>Her hair was like a curtain</br>Falling open with the laughter</br>And closing with the lies</br>But the ghost of her still lingers on</br>Though she's passed through me</br>And is gone</br>The slum dogs, they are barking</br>And the rain children on the streets</br>And the tears that we will weep today</br>Will all be washed away</br>By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>For the road is long</br>And the road is hard</br>And many fall by the side</br>But Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>So there ain't no need to cry</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>And I came upon a little house</br>A little house upon a hill</br>And I entered through, the curtain hissed</br>Into the house with its blood red bowels</br>Where wet lipped women with greasy fists</br>Crawled the ceilings and the walls</br>They filled me full of drink</br>And led me round the rooms</br>Naked and cold and grinning</br>Until everything went black</br>And I came down spinning</br>I awoke so drunk and full of rage</br>That I could hardly speak</br>A fag in a whale bone corset</br>Draping his dick across my cheek</br>And its into the shame</br>And its into a guilt</br>And its into the fucking fray</br>And the walls ran red around me</br>A warm arterial spray</br>Saying</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Well, the night is dark</br>And the night is deep</br>And its jaws are open wide</br>But Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>So there ain't no need to cry</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>It's the rainy season where I'm living</br>Death comes leaping out of every doorway</br>Wasting you for money, for your clothes</br>And for your nothing</br>Entire towns being washed away</br>Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways</br>Lynch mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains</br>The mad heat and the relentless rains</br>And if you stick your arm into that hole</br>It comes out shit up to the bone</br>And with her kisses bubbling on my lips</br>I swiped the rain and nearly missed</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>Singing</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>Papa won't leave you, Boy</br>Well, the road is long</br>And the road is hard</br>And many fall by the side</br>But Papa won't leave you, Henry</br>So there ain't no need to cry</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>And I went on down the road</br>He went on down the road</br>Bent Beneath my heavy load</br>Under his heavy load</br>Yeah, I went on down the road</br>Yeah, he went on down the road</br>Woah, woah</br>Woah, woah</br>Woah, woah</br>Woah, woah</br>And I went on down that road<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 :
