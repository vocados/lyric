</script> <p>They're selling postcards of the hanging</br>They're painting the passports brown</br>The beauty parlor is filled with sailors</br>The circus is in town</br>Here comes the blind commissioner</br>They've got him in a trance</br>One hand is tied to the tight rope walker</br>The other is in his pants</br>And the riot squad they're restless</br>They need somewhere to go</br>As Lady and I look out tonight</br>From Desolation Row</br>Cinderella, she seems so easy</br>It takes one to know one, she smiles</br>And puts her hands in her back pockets</br>Bette Davis style</br>And in comes Romeo, he's moaning</br>You belong to Me I Believe</br>And someone says, You're in the wrong place, my friend</br>You'd better leave</br>And the only sound that's left</br>After the ambulances go</br>Is Cinderella sweeping up</br>On Desolation Row</br>Now the moon is almost hidden</br>The stars are beginning to hide</br>The fortune telling lady</br>Has even taken all her things inside</br>All except for Cain and Abel</br>And the hunchback of Notre Dame</br>Everybody is making love</br>Or else expecting rain</br>And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing</br>He's getting ready for the show</br>He's going to the carnival tonight</br>On Desolation Row</br>Ophelia, she's 'neath the window</br>For her I feel so afraid</br>On her twenty second birthday</br>She already is an old maid</br>To her, death is quite romantic</br>She wears an iron vest</br>Her profession's her religion</br>Her sin is her lifelessness</br>And though her eyes are fixed upon</br>Noah's great rainbow</br>She spends her time peeking</br>Into Desolation Row</br>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood</br>With his memories in a trunk</br>Passed this way an hour ago</br>With his friend, a jealous monk</br>NOW, he looked so immaculately frightful</br>As he bummed a cigarette</br>Then he went off sniffing drainpipes</br>And reciting the alphabet</br>You would not think to look at him</br>But he was famous long ago</br>For playing the electric violin</br>On Desolation Row</br>Dr Filth, he keeps his world</br>Inside of a leather cup</br>But all his sexless patients</br>They ARE trying to blow it up</br>Now his nurse, some local loser</br>She's in charge of the cyanide hole</br>And she also keeps the cards that read</br>Have Mercy on His Soul</br>They all play on the penny whistle</br>You can hear them blow</br>If you lean your head out far enough</br>From Desolation Row</br>Across the street they've nailed the curtains</br>They're getting ready for the feast</br>The Phantom of the Opera</br>In a perfect image of a priest</br>They are spoon feeding Casanova</br>To get him to feel more assured</br>Then they'll kill him with self confidence</br>After poisoning him with words</br>And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls</br>Get outta here if you don't know</br>Casanova is just being punished for going</br>To Desolation Row</br>At midnight all the agents</br>And the superhuman crew</br>Come out and round up everyone</br>That knows more than they do</br>Then they bring them to the factory</br>Where the heart attack machine</br>Is strapped across their shoulders</br>And then the kerosene</br>Is brought down from the castles</br>By insurance men who go</br>Check to see that nobody is escaping</br>To Desolation Row</br>Praise be to Nero's Neptune</br>The Titanic sails at dawn</br>Everybody's shouting</br>Which side are you on</br>And Ezra Pound and T S Eliot</br>Fighting in the captain's tower</br>While calypso singers laugh at them</br>And fishermen hold flowers</br>Between the windows of the sea</br>Where lovely mermaids flow</br>And nobody has to think too much</br>About Desolation Row</br>Yes, I received your letter yesterday</br>About the time the door knob broke</br>When you asked me how I was doing</br>Or was that some kind of joke</br>All these people that you mention</br>Yes, I know them, they're quite lame</br>I had to rearrange their faces</br>And give them all another name</br>Right now I can't read too good</br>Don't send me no more letters no</br>Not unless you mail them</br>From Desolation
