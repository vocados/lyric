He ain't the guy !" <br>Yes here comes the story of the Hurricane <br>The man the authorities came to blame <br>For something that he never done <br>Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been <br>The champion of the world. <br><br>Four months later the ghettos are in flame <br>Rubin's in South America fighting for his name <br>While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game <br>And the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame <br>"Remember that murder that happened in a bar ?" <br>"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?" <br>"You think you'd like to play ball with the law ?" <br>"Think it might-a been that fighter you saw running that night ?" <br>"Don't forget that you are white". <br><br>Arthur Dexter Bradley said "I'm really not sure" <br>Cops said "A boy like you could use a break <br>We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello <br>Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow <br>You'll be doing society a favor <br>That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver <br>We want to put his ass in stir <br>We want to pin this triple murder on him <br>He ain't no Gentleman Jim". <br><br>Rubin could take a man out with just one punch <br>But he never did like to talk about it all that much <br>It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay <br>And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way <br>Up to some paradise <br>Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice <br>And ride a horse along a trail <br>But then they took him to the jailhouse <br>Where they try to turn a man into a mouse. <br><br>All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance <br>The trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance <br>The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums <br>To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum <br>And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger <br>No one doubted that he pulled the trigger <br>And though they could not produce the gun <br>The DA said he was the one who did the deed <br>And the all-white jury agreed. <br><br>Rubin Carter was falsely tried <br>The crime was murder 'one' guess who testified <br>Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied <br>And the newspapers they all went along for the ride <br>How can the life of such a man <br>Be in the palm of some fool's hand ? <br>To see him obviously framed <br>Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land <br>Where justice is a game. <br><br>Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties <br>Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise <br>While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell <br>An innocent man in a living hell <br>That's the story of the Hurricane <br>But it won't be over till they clear his name <br>And give him back the time he's done <br>Put him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been <br>The champion of the world. </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Essential Bob Dylan (Revised)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2016-10-15</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
