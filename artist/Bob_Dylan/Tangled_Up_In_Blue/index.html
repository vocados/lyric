Bob Dylan<br><br> Early one morning the sun was shining <br>I was laying in bed <br>Wond'ring if she'd changed it all <br>If her hair was still red <br>Her folks they said our lives together <br>Sure was gonna be rough <br>They never did like Mama's homemade dress <br>Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough <br>And I was standing on the side of the road <br>Rain falling on my shoes <br>Heading out for the East Coast <br>Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>She was married when we first met <br>Soon to be divorced <br>I helped her out of a jam I guess <br>But I used a little too much force <br>We drove that car as far as we could <br>Abandoned it out West <br>Split it up on a dark sad night <br>Both agreeing it was best <br>She turned around to look at me <br>As I was walking away <br>I heard her say over my shoulder <br>We'll meet again someday on the avenue <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>I had a job in the great north woods <br>Working as a cook for a spell <br>But I never did like it all that much <br>And one day the ax just fell <br>So I drifted down to New Orleans <br>Where I happened to be employed <br>Working for a while on a fishing boat <br>Right outside of Delacroix <br>But all the while I was alone <br>The past was close behind <br>I seen a lot of women <br>But she never escaped my mind and I just grew <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>She was working in a topless place <br>And I stopped in for a beer <br>I just kept looking at her side of her face <br>In the spotlight so clear <br>And later on as the crowd thinned out <br>I was just about to do the same <br>She was standing there in back of my chair <br>Said to me Don't I know your name <br>I muttered something underneath my breath <br>She studied the lines on my face <br>I must admit I felt a little uneasy <br>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe <br>I thought you'd never say hello she said <br>You look like the silent type <br>Then she opened up a book of poems <br>And handed it to me <br>Written by an Italian poet <br>From the fifteenth century <br>And every one of them words rang true <br>And glowed like burning coal <br>Pouring off of every page <br>Like it was written in my soul from me to you <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>I lived with them on Montague Street <br>In a basement down the stairs <br>There was music in the cafe at night <br>And revolution in the air <br>Then he started into dealing with slaves <br>And something inside of him died <br>She had to sell everything she owned <br>And froze up inside <br>And when finally the bottom fell out <br>I became withdrawn <br>The only thing I knew how to do <br>Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew <br>Tangled up in blue <br><br>So now I'm going back again <br>I got to get her somehow <br>All the people we used to know <br>They're an illusion to me now <br>Some are mathematicians <br>Some are carpenter's wives <br>Don't know how it all got started <br>I don't what they're doing with their lives <br>But me I'm still on the road <br>Heading for another joint <br>We always did feel the same <br>We just saw it from a different point of view <br>Tangled up in Blue </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Bob Dylan Gold : The Answer Is Blowin` In The Wind (Korean Fan`s Selection)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-28</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
