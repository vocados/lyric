</script> <p>I was riding on the Mayflower</br>When I thought I spied some land</br>I yelled for Captain Arab</br>I have yuh understand</br>Who came running to the deck</br>Said, Boys, forget the whale</br>Look on over yonder</br>Cut the engines</br>Change the sail</br>Haul on the bowline</br>We sang that melody</br>Like all tough sailors do</br>When they are far away at sea</br>I think I'll call it America</br>I said as we hit the land</br>I took a deep breath</br>I fell down, I could not stand</br>Captain Arab he started</br>Writing up some deeds</br>He said, Let's set up a fort</br>And start buying the place with beads</br>Just then this cop comes down the street</br>Crazy as a loon</br>He throw us all in jail</br>For carryin' harpoons</br>Ah me I busted out</br>Don't even ask me how</br>I went to get some help</br>I walked by a Guernsey cow</br>Who directed me down</br>To the Bowery slums</br>Where people carried signs around</br>Saying, Ban the bums</br>I jumped right into line</br>Sayin' I hope that I'm not late</br>When I realized I hadn't eaten</br>For five days straight</br>I went into a restaurant</br>Lookin' for the cook</br>I told him I was the editor</br>Of a famous etiquette book</br>The waitress he was handsome</br>He wore a powder blue cape</br>I ordered some suzette, I said</br>Could you please make that crepe</br>Just then the whole kitchen exploded</br>From boillin' fat</br>Food was flying anywhere</br>And I left without my had</br>Now, I didn't mean to be nosy</br>But I went into a bank</br>To get some bail for Arab</br>And all the boys back in the tank</br>They asked me for some collateral</br>And I pulled down my pants</br>They threw me in the alley</br>When up comes this girl from France</br>Who invited me to her house</br>I went, but she had a friend</br>Who knocked me out</br>And robbed my boots</br>And I was on the street again</br>Well, I rapped upon a house</br>With the US flag upon display</br>I said, Could you help me out</br>I got some friends down the way</br>The man says, Get out of here</br>I'll tear you limp from limb</br>I said, You know they refused Jesus, too</br>He said, You're not Him</br>Get out of here before I break your bones</br>I ain't your pop</br>I decided to have him arrested</br>And I went lookin for a cop</br>I ran right outside</br>And I hopped inside a cab</br>I went out the other door</br>This Englishman said, Fab</br>As he saw me leap a hot dog stand</br>And a chariot that stood</br>Parked across from a building</br>Advertising brotherhood</br>I ran right through the front door</br>Like a hobo sailor does</br>But it was just a funeral parlor</br>And the man asked me who I was</br>I repeated that my friends</br>Where all in jail, with a sigh</br>He gave me his card</br>He said, Call me if they die</br>I shook his hand and said goodbye</br>Ran out to the street</br>When a bowling ball came down the road</br>And knocked me off my feet</br>A pay phone was ringing</br>It just about blew my mind</br>When I picked it up and said hello</br>This foot came through the line</br>Well, by this time I was feed up</br>At tryin'g to make a stab</br>At bringin' back any help</br>For my friends and captain Arab</br>I decided to flip a coin</br>Like either heads or tails</br>Would let me know if I should go</br>Back to the ship or back to jail</br>So I hooked my sailor suit</br>And I got a coin to flip</br>It came up tails</br>It rhymed with sails</br>So I made it back to the ship</br>Well, I got back and took</br>The parkin' ticket off the mast</br>I was ripping it to shreds</br>When this coastguard boat went past</br>They asked me my name</br>And I said, Captain Kidd</br>They believed me but</br>They wanted to know</br>What exactly that I did</br>I said for the Pope of Eruke</br>I was employed</br>They let me go right away</br>They were very paranoid</br>Well, the last I heard of Arab</br>He was stuck on a whale</br>That was married to the deputy</br>Sheriff of the jail</br>But the funniest thing was</br>When I was leavin' the bay</br>I saw three ships a sailin'</br>There were all heading my way</br>I asked the captain what his name was</br>And how come he didn't drive a truck</br>He said his name was Columbus</br>I just said, Good luck<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : The Original Mono Recordings</h2><h3
