</script> <p>Listen</br>Kato on the track bitch</br>Yeah</br>Think about the moment when your boy was unemployed and I couldn't pay the fucking rent</br>Started making music but it wasn't making money so I used it as a way to vent</br>Had to take a loan from my father I was bothered I was harboring some ill intent</br>He'll admit, never thought we'd make it this far his bars got a way of shaking things, I can feel this shit</br>That was it, thinking back to '05 when I had that '05 so far I had set a precedent</br>I was with my cousin at the dope spot when the foe shot loved ones and the killers had the crescent lit</br>And I've been focused ever since, credit go to Nessa told me, nigga don't be hesitant</br>I done made more in this last half year then I did in my career, really that is no embellishment</br>I don't give a fuck about nobody else opinion, what nobody else is penning, I ain't swimming in the shallow end</br>I remember when they tried to tell me I could never make an album independent that was sick unless I followed them</br>But I could never follow trends, I just keep it honest, I don't play into the politics</br>I be having bitches, I ain't even got to try</br>They applying for positions like their vying for a scholarship</br>I done been, all up in the midst of the miscellaneous misses that try to visit his business but diss him heinous</br>But that is the business ain't it, shit is anticipated, they want me to go at rappers but get no participation and uh</br>Fuck y'all really want to prove Bobby Fischer, I can see your next 'hunnid moves</br>Trying to creep up on a player but I'm so in tune</br>And you used to talk about it, I'm the fucking truth</br>I know this scene, I know what to do</br>They follow my lead, they watching my moves</br>Think about me, now worry about you, and shit y'all could do</br>Y'all in the game, but I make the moves</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas talk more than these bitches</br>These bitches will catch you a body</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas be cuffing these bitches</br>These bitches be off catching bodies</br>I've been in certain bars where I was diverted from</br>What I would initially do whenever the burden comes</br>Or whether or not I want to respond, play it off as a qualm, or calmly disregard and infer upon</br>Upon further review, I was unnerving a few niggas that tried to tell me I wasn't deserving I knew</br>What I was up against, so I would succumb intense</br>Personal adverse, the worst was self induced</br>I don't recall a time, that I was at all given</br>What I did not earn so I'm not at all smitten</br>By your concern at any negative turn that you disguised as love, but shovel shit when I'm not looking</br>Why you was onlooking, I steadily grew a team</br>Started to get attention, but that could be too extreme</br>Sort of a lucid dream, nothing you used to seeing</br>Look in my inbox, and nigga it's all women</br>I just continue to fill up these venues and murder these stages, I'm getting my bread</br>I am no longer dependent on niggas I have no more worries, I'm thoroughly fed</br>I made decisions to make some revisions to people in my life, so some of them fled</br>Makes me no difference if you show resistance we heard your opinions now lay in your bed</br>Mention my name and they react the same</br>I struggled and bled for the shit that I've done</br>Everything up to this point, good or bad, regardless it made me the man I've become</br>I find it fitting how someone who's sitting so comfortably has an opinion on us</br>Your vision is clouded with whom you surrounded, what you think of me, I do not give a fuck</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas talk more than these bitches</br>These bitches will catch you a body</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas be cuffing these bitches</br>These bitches be off catching bodies</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas talk more than these bitches</br>These bitches will catch you a body</br>I fuck with nobody</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas be cuffing these bitches</br>These bitches be off catching bodies</br>I fuck with nobody</br>Bitches will catch you a body</br>I fuck with nobody</br>These niggas be cuffing these bitches</br>These bitches be out catching bodies</br>Look</br>Look</br>I don't fuck with none of y'all, I be on my own shit</br>Niggas always rap about it, but they never own shit</br>I don't see the point in me pointing out any difference in niggas I wouldn't mention let alone get along with</br>On with the thought of proceeding people be reading</br>Deep into what they need, so sorry this where I leave you</br>Nothing more I could feed you, witnessed what I had weaved through</br>Good for nothing, but talking, but nigga we don't believe you</br>Head to, this is just a preview, niggas act worse than these hoes, they deceive you</br>You ain't gotta say a single word, I can read you</br>Yeah they show love, but they really want to bleed you</br>And we do, what it is that we do feel, usually the fake ones claiming that they too real</br>They just keep talking and running they mouth like a hobby</br>That's probably the reason I fuck with nobody<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명
