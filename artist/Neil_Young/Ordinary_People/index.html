</script> <p>In a dusty town</br>a clock struck high noon</br>Two men stood face to face</br>One wore black and one wore white</br>But of fear there wasn't a trace</br>Two hundred years later</br>two hot rods drag race</br>through the very same place</br>And a half a million people</br>moved in to pick up the pace</br>A factory full of people</br>Makin' parts to go to outer space</br>A train load of people</br>They were aimin' for another place</br>Out of town people</br>There's a man in the window</br>with a big cigar</br>Says everything's for sale</br>The house and the boat</br>and the railroad car</br>The owner's gotta go to jail</br>He acquired these things</br>from a life of crime</br>Now he's selling them</br>to raise his bail</br>He was rippin' off the people</br>Sellin' guns to the underground</br>Tryin' to help the people</br>Lose their ass</br>for a piece of ground</br>Rippin' off the people</br>Skimmin' the top when</br>there was no one around</br>Tryin' to help the people</br>He was dealing antiques</br>in a hardware store</br>But he sure had a lot to hide</br>He had a backroom full</br>of the guns of war</br>And a ton of ammunition besides</br>Well, he walked with a cane</br>Kept a bolt on the door</br>with five pit bulls inside</br>Just a warning to the people</br>Who might try to break in at night</br>Protection from the people</br>Selling safety</br>in the darkest night</br>Tryin' to help the people</br>Get the drugs</br>to the street all right</br>Ordinary people</br>Well, it's hard to say</br>where a man goes wrong</br>Might be here</br>and it might be there</br>What starts out weak</br>might get too strong</br>If you can't tell foul from fair</br>But it's hard to judge</br>from an angry throng</br>Of hands stretched into the air</br>The vigilante people</br>Takin' law into their own hands</br>Conscientious people</br>Crackin' down on</br>the druglord's land</br>Government people</br>Confiscatin' all</br>the dealer's land</br>Patch of ground people</br>Down at the factory</br>they're puttin' new windows in</br>The vandals made a mess of things</br>And the homeless</br>just walked right in</br>Well, they worked here once</br>and they live here now</br>But they might work here again</br>They're ordinary people</br>And they're livin' in a nightmare</br>Hard workin' people</br>And they don't know</br>how they got there</br>Ordinary people</br>And they think that you don't care</br>Hard workin' people</br>Down on the assembly line</br>they keep puttin'</br>the same thing out</br>But the people today</br>they just ain't buyin'</br>Nobody can figure it out</br>Well, they try like hell</br>to build a quality end</br>They're workin' hard</br>without a doubt</br>They're ordinary people</br>And the dollar's</br>what it's all about</br>Hard workin' people</br>But the customers are walkin' out</br>Lee Iacocca people</br>Yeah, they look</br>but they just don't buy</br>Hard workin' people</br>Two out of work models</br>and a fashion slave</br>Try to dance away</br>the Michelob night</br>The bartender poured</br>himself another drink</br>While two drunks sat</br>watchin' the fight</br>The champ went down</br>then he got up again</br>And then he went out like a light</br>He was fightin' for the people</br>But his timing wasn't right</br>For Las Vegas people</br>Who came to see a Las Vegas fight</br>High rollin' people</br>Takin' limos</br>though the neon night</br>Fightin' for the people</br>And then a new Rolls Royce</br>and a company car</br>They went flyin' down the street</br>Each one tryin'</br>to make it to the gate</br>Before employees manned the fleet</br>The trucks full of products</br>for the modern home</br>Set to roll out into the street</br>Of downtown people</br>Tryin' to make their way to work</br>Nose to the stone people</br>Some are saints, and some are jerks</br>Hard workin' people</br>Stoppin' for a drink</br>on the way to work</br>Alcoholic people</br>Yeah, they're takin' it</br>one day, one day at a time</br>Out on the railroad track</br>they're cleanin' up number 9</br>They're scrubbin' the boiler down</br>well, she really is lookin' fine</br>Ah, she's lookin' so good</br>they're gonna</br>bring her back on line</br>Ordinary people</br>They're gonna bring</br>the good things back</br>Nose to the stone people</br>Put the business
