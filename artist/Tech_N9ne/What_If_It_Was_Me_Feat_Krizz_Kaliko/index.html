fail</br>But people who never quit</br>All I ever wanted was to sell</br>Records to the people make a lot of mil', yessir</br>Rap to me, it was the holy grail</br>I'm gonna go and do it, I'm never gonna fail</br>Yeah, but first I gotta make it out of Hell</br>Wake up and I see crime</br>All of us we on it's eat time</br>My homies love me yelling Peace N9ne</br>At the same time, throwing B signs</br>Throwing em back and repping the street, I'm</br>Doing music and I'm writing beast rhymes</br>But my V Slimes, had no weak minds</br>Got with the music, started a group and we shine</br>Music gave us hella hope</br>Made it up out of the bangin' and sellin' dope</br>We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke</br>Till one of our members found a kid to grope</br>Then your honor gave the peddy the rope</br>Losing a man, the band began to slope</br>Never did think a plan was damned to croak</br>So doing it solo dolo stands the GOAT</br>Started making hella LP's</br>2000, all the way to five, felt free</br>Because of the hand the label dealt me</br>But in '06 Fontana helped us melt cheese</br>Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds, in a minute</br>That's when the government want the sums, then I send it</br>In a couple of months I'm done and replenished</br>Everywhere I go, I'm selling out the show</br>Around the world I kill em and everybody know</br>Whenever we hit the studio and Tecca Nina drop, hot</br>Even though I will go toe to toe if somebody bang on me</br>But I'm rolling in the dough and I'm really respected and protected</br>Chances of me getting shot, not</br>Everyone loving the Tech</br>Publishin', I get a check</br>Loving the cities that with me, the people that call me the best</br>I don't have any regret, but it's a bit of neglect</br>Missing my babies I love em and none of 'em leaving me yet</br>Feeling good like a villain should</br>In a mansion, but I'm still in hoods</br>Not like Trayvon, J's on</br>Khaki shorts with a red tee like I will and could</br>I can conceal it my permits say</br>If evil happens to swerve this way</br>Hope nobody deserves quick spray</br>I feel an angelic surge this day</br>They feeling my songs</br>Been doing it long</br>They want me to sell 'em my CD right outta my home</br>Cos I'm in the zone</br>I'm putting em on in front of the store when a couple of police won't leave me alone</br>Why they tripping</br>I fit the description</br>It's two of them rushing me I'm on a solo mission</br>To get people to listen, but they pushing and kicking me</br>I'm on the ground when they telling me, Cause of a gun suspicion</br>It was in my pocket, ain't trying pop it</br>When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it</br>Then one of em lost it, and then I was shot quick</br>Officers took me to heaven, I'm dead and with multiple rockets</br>Didn't matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players</br>'Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers</br>Fears what I see, making em kill a G</br>Rotten apple in the batch don't tell the rest to flee</br>This happened in Baton, R O U G E, even I fit the description</br>What if it was me</br>What if it was me</br>What if I never got the one chance to be</br>Everything and everywhere I go, I wouldn't see</br>If by your hand you took that from me</br>But what if it were me</br>Laying right there</br>I'll never get up again, it's so unfair</br>My babies cry out</br>You never cared</br>Things that we do make each other so scared</br>So what if it was you there</br>Should I just Take your life</br>Should I bust Make your wife widowed, withered, hugging the pillow</br>The scent of you still on her</br>Spirit she feels on her</br>The whole world weeps</br>Blood we all spill on her</br>And I know, it's ill will the pill's hard to swallow</br>How should I feel when I'm being followed followed</br>By the words that you say to me Crazy</br>And you saved my life, take my life</br>I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists</br>I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with
