Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, the weekend's here</br>Well listen</br>When I was very young I used to sit around the house</br>Watching oil can Harry battle Mighty Mouse</br>Until my mother said, Son, that's not the way to be</br>You've got to go to school and learn your ABCs</br>I said, Is that it, mom</br>She said, That's not even half</br>You've got to go to school, you got to learn some math</br>You got to learn you to count 1, 2, 3</br>And then get brushed up on the history</br>My first day of school I'll never forget</br>My teacher said, Recite the alphabet</br>I said, A E M E L R, and, as you can see</br>I didn't get very far</br>The teacher said, Son, there's nothing to it</br>Before the day's over, you'll learn how to do it</br>And not only that, you'll learn how to read</br>And that's one thing in life you'll always need</br>Well, school's not all work</br>There's fun things to do like gym, lunch, and recess, too</br>Kindergarten was easy, it was mostly

another turn</br>I didn't want to study, didn't even want to learn</br>Didn't want to go to class, I was always late</br>Because school became something that I started to hate</br>Started hanging with my boys, didn't mean no harm</br>We was going around the school pulling fire alarms</br>I was a chilly homeboy, yes, I was down</br>Because I came to school just to mess around</br>I started hanging in the halls, writing on the walls</br>Until I got started playing basketball</br>But I didn't have a job so I couldn't get paid</br>And I couldn't play ball because of my grades</br>But I still used to practice each and every day</br>In case the coach decided to let me play</br>But it didn't work out the way I planned</br>So I ran to a man who said he can understand</br>The troubles I was going through</br>He said, Son it's all about going to school</br>So I shut up and shipped out to get my keys</br>And now I'm moving up to the big leagues, high school</br>S C H O O L, you got to go to

weekend's here</br>So sticking out that chest, I'm feeling cool</br>'Cause I was going on to something they call high school</br>And I feel important, 'cause things aren't the same</br>Wondering why nobody knows my name</br>That became something that I started to miss</br>And now that I'm here it feels like a big dis</br>But, anyway, I had to leave</br>I had something to achieve</br>It was singing, yeah, that's what I wanted to do</br>So I got a tutor, because I'm no fool</br>Dropping out of school is quite absurd</br>And it's something New Edition just spread the word</br>Stay in
