No, no, I couldn't. <br><br>Why not <br><br>Are you sure <br><br>I bought this glove a thousand years ago <br>For some birthday or some Christmas that has come and gone <br>I thought we might play catch or... I don't know <br>But he left it in the bag, with the tag still on <br><br>You'll have to break it in though, first. <br>You can't catch anything with it that stiff. <br><br>How do you break it in <br><br>Well, it's all a process that is really quite precise <br>A sort of secret method known to very few <br>So, if you're in the market for professional advice <br>Well today could be a lucky day for you <br><br>Shaving cream. <br><br>Shaving cream <br><br>Oh yeah. You rub that in for about five minutes, <br>tie it all up with rubber bands, <br>put it under your mattress, and sleep on it. <br>And you do that for at least a week, every day, consistent. <br><br>And though this method isn't easy <br>Every second that you spend is gonna pay off <br>It'll pay off in the end <br><br>It just takes a little patience <br>It takes a little time <br>A little perseverance <br>And a little uphill climb <br><br>You might not think it's worth it <br>You might begin to doubt <br>But you can't take any shortcuts <br>You gotta stick it out <br><br>And it's the hard way <br>But it's the right way <br>The right way... to break in a glove <br><br>With something like this, <br>you gotta be ready to put in the work, <br>make the commitment. So what do you think <br><br>I mean, definitely. <br><br>Some people say just use a microwave <br>Or try that "run it through hot water" technique <br>Well, they can gloat about the time they saved <br>'Til they gotta buy another glove next week <br><br>It just takes a little patience <br><br>It takes a little patience <br><br>Takes a little time <br><br>A little perseverance <br><br>And a little uphill climb <br><br>And it's the hard way <br>But it's the right way <br>The right way... <br><br>'Cause there's a right way in everything you do <br><br>Keep that grit <br>Follow through <br><br>Even when everyone around you thinks you're crazy <br>Even when everyone around you lets things go <br>And whether you're prepping for some test <br>Or you're miles from some goal <br>Or you're just trying to do what's best <br>For a kid who's lost control <br><br>You do the hard thing <br>'Cause that's the right thing <br>Yeah, that's the right thing <br><br>Connor was really lucky to have a dad that... uh, <br>a dad who cared so much about... taking care of stuff. <br><br>Shaving cream, rubber bands, mattress, repeat. <br>Got it <br><br>Got it. <br><br>It's the hard way <br><br>But it's the right way <br><br>The right way <br>To break in a glove <br><br>You're good to go. </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Dear Evan Hansen (Original Broadway Cast Recording)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-02-03</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Musical</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
