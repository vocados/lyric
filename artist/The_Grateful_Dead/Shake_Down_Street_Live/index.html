Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>The sunny side of the street is dark. Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>Maybe that's cause it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides. <br><br>Maybe the dark is from your eyes, Maybe the dark is from your eyes <br>Maybe the dark is from your eyes, Maybe the dark is from your eyes <br>Maybe the dark is from your eyes, Maybe the dark is from your eyes <br>You know you got such dark eyes! <br><br>Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street. Used to be the heart of town. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. You just gotta poke around. <br><br>You think you've seen this town clear through. <br>Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>Nothin' here that could int'rest you. Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start. <br><br>Maybe you had too much too fast. Maybe you had too much too fast. <br>Maybe you had too much too fast. Maybe you had too much too fast. <br>Maybe you had too much too fast. Maybe you had too much too fast. <br>Or just over played your part. <br><br>Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street. Used to be the heart of town. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. You just gotta poke around. <br><br>Since I'm passing your way today. Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>I just stopped in 'cause I want to say, Well, well, well, you can never tell. <br>I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud. <br><br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. <br>When I can hear it beat out loud! <br><br>Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street. Used to be the heart of town. <br>Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. You just gotta poke around. </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Live In Stanford Ca `88 (Live)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2015-09-18</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
