<br><br>Since the far off days when man first heard a scratchy noise <br>On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones <br>It has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism <br>And spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement <br><br>I start to go, my rhymes'll flow <br>So, get up and dance cause Kane said so <br>If you were lounging around it's time to get up <br>Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up <br>I appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer <br>That would dare to compare, I do declare <br>Getting busy is where it's at <br>But what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that <br>Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light <br>But I drop bass just like Barry White <br>So how could you think that you pose a threat <br>You say you're rocking, how many shows you get <br>All your vocals go local on the M I C <br>Mines go a great distance, like ATandT <br>I'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this <br>Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this <br>So, yo, go for what you know <br>Attempt to debate so I can humiliate <br>We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse <br>Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse <br>To take you to your burial ground <br>Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down <br>Correct, I get respect, I'm out to collect <br>Cash money, cause I get raw <br><br>Everybody get up x4 <br>Kane boy do I hate a <br>I'm coming x5 <br><br>Here I am, R A W <br>A terrorist, here to bring trouble to <br>Phony MC's, I move on and seize <br>I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease <br>Cause I'm at my apex and others are below <br>Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo <br>Second to none, making MC's run <br>So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one <br>I relieve rappers just like Tylenol <br>And they know it, so I don't see why you all <br>Try to front, perpetrating a stunt <br>When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt <br>I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi <br>To stage a rage is what rap did to me <br>To make me want to create chaos and mayhem <br>Cold rock a party until the AM <br>I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle <br>While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a <br>Little rhyme with authority, superiority <br>And captivate the whole crowd's majority <br>The rhymes I use definitely amuse <br>Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues <br>I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw <br>Cause I get raw <br><br>Everybody get up x5 <br><br>Give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severing <br>And in my lifetime, believe I've never been <br>Beaten, or eaten and just tooken out <br>You know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out <br>And real nervous when I'm at your service <br>Give me that title, boy, you don't deserve this <br>I work like a slave to become a master <br>And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to <br>Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed <br>The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it <br>I go and flow and grow to let you know <br>I damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro <br>fessional unquestionable without doubt superb <br>So full of action, my name should be a verb <br>My voice will float on every note <br>When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote <br>The minute that the Kane starts to go on <br>Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on <br>As I put other rappers out of their misery <br>Get them in a battle and make them all history <br>Ruling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling <br>Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling <br>On my throne, with a bronze microphone <br>Hmm, God bless the child that can hold his own <br>Cause I get raw <br><br>Ain't it good to you x3 <br>Documentary here's an experiment to begin with <br><br>Twenty four sev chilling, killing like a villain <br>The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing <br>To do whatever is clever, take a loss, never <br>And the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must <br>And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd <br>I rip the microphone and leave it scarred <br>Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff <br>Only crushing MC's that be trying to riff <br>I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic <br>Make MC's panic, they all get frantic <br>And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive <br>As I rock but hey, what you expected <br>I'll get raw for you just like a warrior <br>Rapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I <br>Ever let a Fisher Price MC hang <br>Their rhymes are toy, nothing but yin yang <br>So if we battle on the microphone <br>Bring your own casket and tombstone <br>And I'mma preach your funeral <br>Tell me who in the world could ever come with more <br>I get raw </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Hip-Hop History : The Collection</td></tr><tr><th
