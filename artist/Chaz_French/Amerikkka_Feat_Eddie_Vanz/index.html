Eddie Vanz)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Chaz French<br><br> I say God bless America, America <br>I say God bless America, America <br>Sweet dreams America, America <br><br>Yea ok people say I’m too honest holding onto a promise <br>Just an open book full of novels, fairy tales full of sorrows <br>On negatives I don’t ponder, stay at peace with my conscious <br>Stayed prayed up we gon prosper, got to peep game let it wander <br>Got to crawl before you start walking yea not unless you ahead of time <br>My first step was me jogging, my memories sweet, chin music <br>Let’s kick shit Sean Michaels, got a beer with me Steve Austin <br>Got to stay woke all eyes open they don’t want to see us move forward <br>Got a book bag full of CDs, call justice for Mr Alton <br>We a hundred deep at each market <br>And the police get first dibs for their grandparents and their partners <br>Screamin fuck 12 we don’t cop peace, we don’t eat pigs too often <br>It’s a system built to stop us like why my brothers keep dying <br>Yea why these babies got to grow up with no fathers to look up to man it’s happening too often <br>We tired counting our losses we tired hanging out coffins <br>We tired of knowing that in America being a black man is being cautious <br><br>Yea too many single mommas on this side <br>Yea there’s way too many lies being televised <br>Why they can kill and go home and eat with their family <br>Meanwhile Mr Noble just got 13 years for 2 grams of weed <br>It’s way too many double standards on this side <br>We just seen two black men get killed on Instagram <br>Wish I could put Jesse Williams’ speech on this song <br>And change the world for the better what we got to do we fed up <br><br>God bless America, America <br>A land that’s not so free <br>Said God bless America, America <br>Please take those chains off me <br>Pray for America, America <br>Let my people breathe <br>Being black in America, America <br>Is a dangerous thing to be <br><br>Yea I said I think us as a people should show some unity before an act of violence <br>I think we should march hand in hand without it being a riot <br>I feel like somebody shouldn’t have to die for us to come together <br>See the more we become organized it ain’t shit that they can tell us <br>I know you hate us I know you fuckin hate us I see it <br>I know you intimidated you just imitating the shit that you see <br>That’s how your parents raised ya and that right there has become a routine <br>So am I next should I ever have to reach for my ID, man it’s beyond the police <br>We got to show every boy, an girl, man and women that we all precious in God’s sight <br>Whether black or white, red or blue we’re all human <br>We just need humanity and a little bit of justice in this short life <br>Just put yourself in our shoes said put yourself in Trayvon’s hoodie <br>Put your hands up like Mike Brown, Be 12 with a BB gun or armed and fit the profile <br>Man this shit is unbearable the list can go on and on <br>Are they really hearing us, you know they got fear in us <br>It’s not what we want, just want to be seen as equal, together let’s keep the peace <br>Said God bless America <br><br>God bless America, America <br>The land that’s not so free <br>Said God bless America, America <br>Please take those chains off me <br>Pray for America, America <br>Let my people breathe <br>Being black in America, America <br>Is a dangerous thing to be <br><br>Try making happy music when you ain’t happy, try uplifting your people when you’re at your lowest <br>Try keeping your belief stronger than while hiding every bit of doubt you got in your heart hoping God don’t notice <br>No this this ain’t a cry for help man all I need is an ear <br>And when the inspiration ain’t striking all I need is the spare <br>Time from you if really do care and if you’re willing to hear cause people always got shit to say <br>But it ain’t as wise as the listener, yea I know it take a while to get in line <br>I’m D Rose leave the bullshit right in the nick of time <br>I need closure not selfish though all I need is piece of mind I need loads of it <br>Love we need more of it the world we don’t know of it <br>Need to lift my spirits hop in the uber and go soul searching <br>Even if the surge is a million plus I’m all in for it <br>My mama and my kids still living what I need friends for <br>My brothers feel the same way I feel that’s what I got them for <br>My lows ain’t never been this high <br>Not really complaining cause my karma ain’t never been this good <br>Hard to explain when finding the thinnest line between everything that’s alright <br>And abundant sacrifice that could possibly change your life <br><br>Said I woke up to a song from the birds <br>Walked outside I seen a sunflower grow from the concrete <br>I looked up seen a lightening bug glowing in broad day <br>That’s when it hit me that fear is just and illusion inside me <br>I know my life is beyond me I see my worth everyday <br>I know my people there’s heartbreak written all over your face <br>I went a bought me a mustard seed to remind me of faith <br>And I’ll kick Satan in his ass, tell struggle pardon its way <br>No I won’t let you kill my dream like you did Martin <br>What’s an American dream, when you can’t dream in America <br>No don’t sleep on that balcony they assassinate characters <br>Had to drink a brew or two I swear that shit is unbearable <br>But I’m the living proof of a better you <br>From the letter U, falling down and getting back up <br>Its righteous it makes for a better you <br>It’s time to rewrite history <br>This time we’ll pick a better noose instead of putting it around your neck <br>We gon dangle our success in front of every soul whose heart is grown apart of our neglect <br><br>I just pray you think about me oh darling <br>I just pray you think about me before it’s too late <br>I just pray you make it back home <br>All you got to do is let me know when you’re on the way <br>Cause the sun don’t shine on this side this side too much longer </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>True Colors</td></tr><tr><th
