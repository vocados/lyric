don't stop</br>And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on</br>I met this girl when I was 10 years old</br>And what I loved most she had so much soul</br>She was old school when I was just a shorty</br>Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me</br>On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular</br>Not about the money, those studs was mic checkin' her</br>But I respected her, she hit me in the heart</br>A few New York niggas had did her in the park</br>But she was there for me, and I was there for her</br>Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her</br>And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her</br>Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her</br>Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be</br>'Cause we related, physically and mentally</br>And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around</br>slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground</br>Original, pure, untampered, a down sister</br>Boy, I tell you, I miss her</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>One, two, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yo, we gotta be the sure shot</br>Now periodically I would see</br>Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties</br>She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick</br>Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric</br>Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions</br>She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence</br>About my people she was teachin' me</br>By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me</br>In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach</br>She dug my rap, that's how we got close</br>But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool</br>'Cause around the same time, I went away to school</br>And I'm a man of expandin'</br>So why should I stand in her way</br>She probably get her money in LA</br>And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul</br>She said that the pro black was goin' out of style</br>She said, Afrocentricity was of the past</br>So she got into RandB, hip house, bass, and jazz</br>Now, black music is black music and it's all good</br>I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood</br>'Cause that was good for her</br>She was becomin' well rounded</br>I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit</br>Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone</br>And you could tell by how her titties hung</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>One, two, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative</br>Once the man got to her, he altered her native</br>Told her if she got an image and a gimmick</br>That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy</br>Now I see her in commercials, she's universal</br>She used to only swing it with the inner city circle</br>Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie</br>And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city</br>Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches</br>Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches</br>Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk</br>Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk</br>Stressin' how hardcore and real she is</br>She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz</br>I did her, not just to say that I did it</br>But I'm committed girl, he's committed</br>But so many niggas hit it</br>That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her</br>I see niggas slammin' her, and takin' her to the sewer</br>But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop</br>'Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip hop</br>And to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yo, they gotta be the sure shot</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>And to the beat, y'all, and you don't stop</br>Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop</br>I think
