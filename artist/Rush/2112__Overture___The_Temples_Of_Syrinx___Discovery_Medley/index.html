</script><br> I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon City and sky become one, merging <br>into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as <br>they trace their way across the steely sky I used to think I had a pretty good life here <br>just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple <br>Paper in the evening <br><br>'My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer <br>Planets We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under <br>the Red Star of the Solar Federation The less fortunate gave us a few new moons <br>I believed what I was told I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy Then I found <br>something that changed it all' <br><br>And the meek shall inherit the earth <br><br>'The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city I <br>have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated <br>and directed from within Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by <br>the benevolent wisdom of the priests' <br><br>We've taken care of everything <br>The words you read, the songs you sing <br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes <br>It's one for all and all for one <br>We work together, common sons <br>Never need to wonder how or why <br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx <br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls <br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx <br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls <br><br>Look around at this world we've made <br>Equality our stock in trade <br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man <br>Oh, what a nice, contented world <br>Let the banners be unfurled <br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand <br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx <br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls <br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx <br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls <br><br>'Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I <br>found it I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in <br>my hands I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful' <br><br>'I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound <br>differently As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds <br>and soon my own music How different it could be from the music of the Temples I can't wait <br>to tell the priests about it' <br><br>What can this strange device be <br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound <br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music <br>What can this thing be that I found <br><br>See how it sings like a sad heart <br>And joyously screams out its pain <br>Sounds that build high like a mountain <br>Or notes that fall gently like rain <br><br>I can't wait to share this new wonder <br>The people will all see its light <br>Let them all make their own music <br>The Priests praise my name on this night <br><br>'In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim <br>expressionless faces Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed <br>throughout the silent Temple Hall' <br><br>'Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection <br>Instead of praise, sullen dismissal I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground <br>my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet' <br><br>I know it's most unusual <br>To come before you so <br>But I've found an ancient miracle <br>I thought that you should know <br>Listen to my music <br>And hear what it can do <br>There's something here as strong as life <br>I know that it will reach you <br><br>Yes, we know, it's nothing new <br>It's just a waste of time <br>We have no need for ancient ways <br>The world is doing fine <br>Another toy that helped destroy <br>The elder race of man <br>Forget about your silly whim <br>It doesn't fit the plan <br><br>I can't believe you're saying <br>These things just can't be true <br>Our world could use this beauty <br>Just think what we might do <br>Listen to my music <br>And hear what it can do <br>There's something here as strong as life <br>I know that it will reach you <br><br>Don't annoy us further <br>We have our work to do <br>Just think about the average <br>What use have they for you <br>Another toy that helped destroy <br>The elder race of man <br>Forget about your silly whim <br>It doesn't fit the Plan <br><br>'I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me Clearly yet I see <br>the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase' <br><br>'I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man <br>revealed in the lives and works of this world I was overwhelmed by both wonder and <br>understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed <br>by the Federation long ago I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of <br>all these things' <br><br>I wandered home through the silent streets <br>And fell into a fitful sleep <br>Escape to realms beyond the night <br>Dream can't you show me the light <br><br>I stand atop a spiral stair <br>An oracle confronts me there <br>He leads me on light years away <br>Through astral nights, galactic days <br>I see the works of gifted hands <br>That grace this strange and wondrous land <br>I see the hand of man arise <br>With hungry mind and open eyes <br><br>They left the planet long ago <br>The elder race still learn and grow <br>Their power grows with purpose strong <br>To claim the home where they belong <br>Home to tear the Temples down <br>Home to change <br><br>'I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total <br>despair I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now I can no longer live <br>under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go My last hope is <br>that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last' <br><br>The sleep is still in my eyes <br>The dream is still in my head <br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile <br>And lie a while in bed <br>I wish that it might come to pass <br>Not fade like all my dreams <br><br>Just think of what my life might be <br>In a world like I have seen <br>I don't think I can carry on <br>Carry on this cold and empty life <br><br>My spirits are low in the depths of despair <br>My lifeblood <br>Spills over <br><br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation <br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation <br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation <br>We have assumed control <br>We have assumed control <br>We have assumed control </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th
