one, merging</br>into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as</br>they trace their way across the steely sky I used to think I had a pretty good life here</br>just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple</br>Paper in the evening</br>'My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer</br>Planets We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under</br>the Red Star of the Solar Federation The less fortunate gave us a few new moons</br>I believed what I was told I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy Then I found</br>something that changed it all'</br>And the meek shall inherit the earth</br>'The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city I</br>have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated</br>and directed from within Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by</br>the benevolent wisdom of the priests'</br>We've taken care of everything</br>The words you read, the songs you sing</br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes</br>It's one for all and all for one</br>We work together, common sons</br>Never need to wonder how or why</br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx</br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls</br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx</br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls</br>Look around at this world we've made</br>Equality our stock in trade</br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man</br>Oh, what a nice, contented world</br>Let the banners be unfurled</br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand</br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx</br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls</br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx</br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls</br>'Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I</br>found it I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in</br>my hands I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful'</br>'I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound</br>differently As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds</br>and soon my own music How different it could be from the music of the Temples I can't wait</br>to tell the priests about it'</br>What can this strange device be</br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound</br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music</br>What can this thing be that I found</br>See how it sings like a sad heart</br>And joyously screams out its pain</br>Sounds that build high like a mountain</br>Or notes that fall gently like rain</br>I can't wait to share this new wonder</br>The people will all see its light</br>Let them all make their own music</br>The Priests praise my name on this night</br>'In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim</br>expressionless faces Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed</br>throughout the silent Temple Hall'</br>'Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection</br>Instead of praise, sullen dismissal I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground</br>my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet'</br>I know it's most unusual</br>To come before you so</br>But I've found an ancient miracle</br>I thought that you should know</br>Listen to my music</br>And hear what it can do</br>There's something here as strong as life</br>I know that it will reach you</br>Yes, we know, it's nothing new</br>It's just a waste of time</br>We have no need for ancient ways</br>The world is doing fine</br>Another toy that helped destroy</br>The elder race of man</br>Forget about your silly whim</br>It doesn't fit the plan</br>I can't believe you're saying</br>These things just can't be true</br>Our world could use this beauty</br>Just think what we might do</br>Listen to my music</br>And hear what it can do</br>There's something here as strong as life</br>I know that it will reach you</br>Don't annoy us further</br>We have our work to do</br>Just think about the average</br>What use have they for you</br>Another toy that helped destroy</br>The elder race of man</br>Forget about your silly whim</br>It doesn't fit the Plan</br>'I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me Clearly yet I see</br>the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase'</br>'I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man</br>revealed in the lives and works of this world I was overwhelmed by both wonder and</br>understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed</br>by the Federation long ago I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of</br>all these things'</br>I wandered home through the silent streets</br>And fell into a fitful sleep</br>Escape to realms beyond the night</br>Dream can't you show me the light</br>I stand atop a spiral stair</br>An oracle confronts me there</br>He leads me on light years away</br>Through astral nights, galactic days</br>I see the works of gifted hands</br>That grace this strange and wondrous land</br>I see the hand of man arise</br>With hungry mind and open eyes</br>They left the planet long ago</br>The elder race still learn and grow</br>Their power grows with purpose strong</br>To claim the home where they belong</br>Home to tear the Temples down</br>Home to change</br>'I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total</br>despair I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now I can no longer live</br>under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go My last hope is</br>that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last'</br>The sleep is still in my eyes</br>The dream is still in my head</br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile</br>And lie a while in bed</br>I wish that it might come to pass</br>Not fade like all my dreams</br>Just think of what my life might be</br>In a world like I have seen</br>I don't think I can carry on</br>Carry on this cold and empty life</br>My spirits are low in the depths of despair</br>My lifeblood</br>Spills over</br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation</br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation</br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation</br>We have assumed control</br>We have assumed control</br>We have assumed control<h2
