they turn the lights out</br>All the young niggas with me and they iced out</br>I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house</br>I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out</br>[Verse 1: Meek Mill]</br>We never live for tomorrow, new half a brick in the car</br>Rich and my chick is a star, I never wish on a star</br>Pull up and sit on the car, 'member when we used to starve</br>Most of these niggas is frauds, they not who they said that they are</br>Niggas do it for the Internet</br>We ain't really really into that</br>Push a foreign but you rented that</br>Shoot a scene, gotta give it back</br>Took a loss on a lil cash</br>I ain't trip about it, had to get it back</br>Move work like SlimFast</br>Niggas in and out it with a fifty pack</br>Plugged in with the plugs, spikes on with the blood</br>Fell back, got the Balmains 'cause the pockets only fit a dub</br>That was never what it was, I'ma tell it like it is</br>Bust down with the sig, whole gang with me on the way to LIV</br>[Hook: Meek Mill]</br>When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out</br>All the young niggas with me and they iced out</br>I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house</br>I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out</br>[Verse 2: Don Q]</br>Every nigga with me iced out</br>Diamonds dance when the lights out</br>I just upgraded my lifestyle</br>Overnight and they like, "How?"</br>I treat my whip like a pet</br>I step on the gas and you hear the pipes growl</br>I got like twenty on me at the car wash</br>Got the Benz getting wiped down</br>Diss records, keep my name out it</br>I promise you won't get no fame out it</br>Driving by certain trap houses</br>Reminiscing when I used to sling out it</br>My life was excitin', all of this ice on</br>You catch me in Dyckman, I make it look easy</br>They hate when they see me, I'm high on the Deegan</br>I'm speeding with Meeky and chasing the 'ghini</br>When you broke, you just feel abandoned</br>Crowd screaming and I hear 'em chant</br>Watch me steer the Phantom when I'm in the Hamptons</br>Same crew since when I was wearin' Vansons</br>It's show time when the gang appearin'</br>Niggas hating but the bitches starin'</br>Who would think that I'd get a mansion?</br>Twenty chains in the mirror dancin'</br>[Hook: Meek Mill]</br>When I walk up in this bitch, they

Meek Mill]</br>New crib with the elevator</br>I got hella haters and they mad at me</br>Up in Niemans, going bad at it</br>Canada, like it was mad madness</br>'Member back when I was dead pop</br>Pretty bitches used to laugh at us</br>Now I pull up in the red drop</br>With the thirty on me and the red dot</br>And I lean on 'em when I come through like, "Swerve"</br>Rat niggas up the street, shit, I'm like, "They got some nerve"</br>Every nigga 'round me look like they got them birds</br>Bust down, Big Meech, nigga, we ain't sweet beef, we purge</br>[Verse 4: Don Q]</br>I bet your manager know me, I used to run in them spots</br>We was just punching the last four, you was just punching the clock</br>I just got rid of my last whore, then I gave her mother a shot</br>Pour up, I'm down to my last four, and I fill my cup to the top</br>To my hood, I'm an icon, watching out for the pythons</br>10K on the left wrist, another dub on my right arm</br>I still come and spend nights on corners niggas took lives on</br>And they ain't lackin', believe me, they packin'</br>My youngins, they keeping they pipes drawn</br>[Hook: Meek Mill]</br>When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the
