bitches and that pussy taste like caviar</br>I done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart</br>Rollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred</br>Heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk</br>I won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar</br>Feel this shit in all my verses</br>Was it really worth it</br>Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface</br>Nobody's perfect</br>Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous</br>Maybe I'm trippin'</br>Hoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in</br>Watched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges</br>Nigga, you suck at friendships, something you got to live with</br>Fuck it!</br>[Chorus]</br>I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)</br>Always kept it
