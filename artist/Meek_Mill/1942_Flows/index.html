Ghost, Wraith, Wraith when you see me</br>Some suckers wanna be and some suckers wanna leave it</br>I go through it, don't' show it</br>I told niggas who wrote it, ain't taking back what I quoted</br>Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half, turned that to an ounce</br>Got some shit in the stash, nigga say he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass</br>Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass</br>And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to the bag</br>Had to starve all day just to get to it fast</br>Ramadan, toting K's like it's Palestine</br>Real niggas and my
