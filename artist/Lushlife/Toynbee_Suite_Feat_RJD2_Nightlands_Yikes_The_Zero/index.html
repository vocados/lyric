RJD2, Nightlands, Yikes The Zero)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Lushlife<br><br> I started walking with the birds <br>Wishing we'd never die <br>Never be lost and gone <br>If we levitate <br>Or we reach the sky <br>All a lie <br>All my life <br>I always wondered why <br>If the promises of the gods <br>Is just flaws of the human mind <br>Human lives depreciated <br>Molecules is vibrating <br>'Til they alleviated <br>The face of everything <br>Everywhere is forever changing <br>So why, bottom line <br>Technology won't be the spaceship <br>That's on some outer space shit <br>Right now <br>If heaven don't exist <br>Then it don't mean it won't <br>It's just the next ledge of evolution <br>That we could hope <br>They build the data <br>Build a ladder <br>Then we rise up <br>Sing it, black <br>Spin it back <br>A puzzle 'til they wise up <br>But they won't listen <br>I'm spitting <br>Rapping tradition <br>The vision of every human in history <br>Wizen, living <br>It's gold dust <br>But, Larry King <br>Hellion gold rush <br>That's when I begged and I tried <br>And they had me <br>Choked up <br><br>Murder every journalist <br>They won't hear a word of it <br>Tell 'em what I could see <br>In the asphalt <br>They heard of it <br>Why David Mamet <br>Don't lie <br>You deserving it <br>Spitting truth in the <br>Cracks of the asphalt <br>They heard of it <br><br>Dave, Stop, Stop, Dave, Stop, Dave, Stop, Get up <br><br>Set trips in visual clips <br>Several fits to launch scripts <br>This monolith in blur <br>Tap matter format shattered <br>The attic swells all parallel data lost <br>This black orbit is flushed <br>Dust settle on plan Z your planet is stumped <br>In a trance to cause puppets to run amuck <br>Controlling terror in an era that's pushed back <br>Steps through the mirror while reality cracks <br>Shift <br>Hate to pretend <br>Surrender time and again <br>The possibilities insist, it's never an end <br>Dream seems to be shattered from jump <br>Your looking at me <br>I'm looking at you <br>Do we need to agree <br>Memory banks flooded gut human condition <br>All premonition is lost here but nobody listens <br><br>If you watch <br>Then the words just come alive <br>And the dream <br>Feel real in a lullaby <br>Why I'm spending my life <br>Telling them otherwise <br>If she dies <br>Then I'm live on the other side <br>So I drive all night <br>Just to tell 'em <br>Maybe if they see it <br>Then the world won't dead 'em <br>Ghosts in they heads <br>And they just won't listen <br>So I'm back on the block <br>In the 'Lac <br>With a mission <br>I'm a spit a shortwave transmission <br>Interrupting the Hellions <br>On the television <br>Floss when they living <br>Lost in the myriad lies of politicians <br>Lost in the prism <br>All I really want <br>Is birds in the junipers <br>If the world don't stop <br>From the Lucifers <br>I'll be happy that they <br>Live in the universe <br>Eternally yours <br>Waiting here for Jupiter <br>Plus, back home <br>I never answer the phone <br>I'm all alone <br>South Philly Hellion Thugs <br>Like a Terrordome <br>Never known <br>Sleep with the birds <br>'Til they send me home <br>Knight Ridder <br>Nightmare <br>Nighttimes, I'm dead and gone <br>With all the lights out <br>The birds is chirping <br>I'm steady working my life out <br>That's that accordion <br>Humming before the night's out <br>'Cause when they send 'em <br>To get me <br>They read my rights out, black <br>Then it's lights out <br>Secure the blast door <br>Or flee the country <br>With money <br>And just a passport <br>The Grinning Man <br>Is just spinning inside the Task Force <br>So, I don't want to be <br>Asking him what the mask for <br>That's what the last bol <br>This ain't Bradbury <br>This ain't Roddenberry <br>It's just a matter of fact <br>This isn't monetary <br>The monastery is a Hellion Cult <br>That's out to get me <br>Out to wet me <br>With a million volts, and uh <br><br>All anyone ever told me is, Yo, it's copasetic <br><br>Santiago, Chile <br>To New York City <br>Or Back to Philly, I'm <br>Working on a scheme <br>A dream for the millions <br>Phenomenon that I seen <br>About the Hellions <br>Ideology <br>Scream Phoenix <br>And they just tell me I'm <br>All lost in cinema <br>Instead of writing my senators <br>I'm inventing a new way <br>Of telling them <br>How they ended up <br>Lost in the newspapers <br>Too late for sending up <br>I don't want to be <br>Hit by the union goons <br>They setting up <br><br>All anyone ever told me is, Yo, it's copasetic <br><br>Back to life again <br>Back up on the corner spot <br>Either on the block <br>Back on the mic again <br>Ghost in your soul <br>Still just a likening <br>Still feel the world in my face <br>And it's still frightening <br>Lush Vida supreme <br>Where Jupiter was still a dream <br>In a gas giant <br>Last of the Ibrahims <br>Last of the Philistines <br>Everybody still alive <br>Ghost in the kerosene <br>Celebrate the Eloheim <br>Whatever you wanted <br>I gave it to you readily <br>My head is full of ghosts <br>Science is ahead of me <br>Melody in the atoms <br>Vibrating and they telling me <br>It's still possible but I'm tired <br>The drive dead in me <br>Resurrect the legacy <br>And I'm a be there <br>My sister gon' be there <br>My mother gon' be there <br>The birds gonna be there <br>The birds gonna be there <br>The birds gonna be there </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Ritualize</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-04-20</td></tr><tr><th
