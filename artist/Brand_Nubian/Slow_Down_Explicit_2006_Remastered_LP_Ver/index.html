where he got 'em cause I hid 'em behind my speakers</br>The object of your affection is the tree top connection</br>Where basically you love to smoke your wools</br>The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door</br>I don't smoke jums so what they knocking for</br>Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you</br>Street time is limited to days</br>On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back</br>Damn it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials</br>With a wide eyed look and a rotten toothed smile</br>Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger</br>From one spot on to the next spot on to the next spot on to the next</br>Bitch get a job, from me you won't rob</br>Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand</br>Now give that to the crack man</br>You was fly once now you're losing all your fronts</br>Started off light only tipping woolie blunts</br>But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe</br>Took a long pull hype</br>Yeah, head crack head crack</br>You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back</br>Hey yo X, wasn't that your girl</br>Yeah I had to drop her</br>Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her</br>Slow down</br>What I am is what I am</br>I knew this girl named Tropicana</br>She's always juicing</br>Producing cash from her sexual tasks</br>She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat</br>You ain't paid then your grade is incomplete</br>You've got to flash dollars, to prove her</br>And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover</br>Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes</br>Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive</br>What I am is what I am</br>Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt</br>And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram</br>I've seen your kind before you're not original</br>Just a sick mixed up individual</br>Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch</br>Marking off the goods you get going up another notch</br>Your ways and actions are like those of a savage</br>If the price is right, then anyone can ravage</br>Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order</br>What's really scary is you're somebody's daughter</br>So don't come around, trying to make a profit</br>At the expense of another man, stop it</br>Cause you see you're the freak show of the town</br>And what I think you ought to do is</br>Slow down Slow down Slow down Slow down</br>Slow down Slow down Slow down</br>What I am is what I am x2</br>As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt</br>A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants</br>But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic</br>And if you swing an ep you'd better wear a prophylactic</br>Cause things are getting drastic</br>Slide up in the wrong one you'll end up in a casket</br>Slow down</br>Sister, there's no need in speeding</br>She was doing lays before she started bleeding</br>What makes a bitch want to act in this fashion</br>Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson</br>A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner</br>Lay the bitch on the bed and then you run right in her</br>Puba makes no mistakes</br>She said, Rock me tonight for old time's sake</br>Picture that</br>Slow Down</br>You little hooker</br>Honey got a problem with the bends</br>Meaning she likes to bend over, and then she spreads the skins</br>The ho is just ho and that's without no controversy</br>She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy</br>Come on toots you can take a thousand douche</br>Scrub that ass and I'll still pass</br>Slow down</br>You're living foul</br>Slow down x2</br>Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing</br>Cause it's not the season</br>So if you want to live foul and be a dumb diddy dumb dumb bitch</br>Well go ahead</br>You're living foul</br>I'd like to give a special shout to my DJ Alamo on the help out</br>Right by my side</br>Slow
