shall be first</br>The basic instructions before leaving earth</br>Life is a test many quest the universe</br>And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt</br>The first shall be last and the last shall be first</br>The basic instructions before leaving earth</br>Knowledge is wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve</br>I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell</br>Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears</br>Years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear</br>I searched for the truth since my youth</br>And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot</br>That I was paying plus the praying</br>I didn't like staying cause of busy bodies and dizzy hotties</br>That the preacher had souped up with lies</br>Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs</br>During the service he swallowed up the poor</br>And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor</br>But I ignored and explored my history that was untold</br>And watched mysteries unfold</br>And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men</br>Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than</br>Space oblivia or the abyss</br>With no trace of trivia left with the hiss</br>Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind</br>From a slave we was kept from the mind</br>And from the caves he crept from behind</br>And what he gave was the sect of the swine</br>When the Bible, it condemned the pig</br>I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs</br>But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban</br>No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie</br>No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts</br>And put it on the tracks and embroid it through the wax</br>I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time</br>And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme</br>I did it anyway just to wake up the mind</br>Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet</br>Those who sit home or sell books by the market</br>Need to chill and get their mind revived</br>For years religion did nothing but divide</br>The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth</br>Life is a test many quest the universe</br>And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt</br>The first shall be last and the last shall be first</br>The basic instructions before leaving earth</br>I strolled through the books of Job to unfold</br>And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals</br>Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah</br>When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya</br>See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend</br>Why should you die to go to heaven</br>The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace</br>A difficult task I had to take</br>I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when</br>I found out that we were the chosen</br>I deal with the truth, and build with the youth</br>And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop</br>Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men</br>And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs</br>To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion</br>I quiz Son with my wisdom</br>Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted</br>The study of wisdom, I preferred it</br>The understanding, it gave me mental freedom</br>I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam</br>The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia</br>And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander</br>The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown</br>That's how the devils tricked my dome</br>I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn</br>For my nation the seed of Abraham</br>Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew</br>Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils</br>So study and be wise in these days of darkness</br>Peace to my nephew Marcus</br>The basic
