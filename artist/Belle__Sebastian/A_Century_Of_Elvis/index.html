</script><br> We were sitting in the living room on the sofa, the wrong way round, looking out the window <br>It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road we saw Elvis look, there beside the postman's van <br>and he was walking round the postman's van, looking in the open door <br>He looked as if he was thinking about getting in, but then the postman came back, and he swaggered off <br>walked past the window and down the stairs, and then at the bottom of the stairs right by the caretaker's office <br>he started licking the pavement <br>Every night now since we moved in that new house there's this noise outside the door at just about half seven or eight o' clock every night <br>And if we go and look outside the door, Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in <br>And then he wanders into the living room, maybe sits down on one of the chairs or even lies down on the floor <br>He doesn't say much, he just stays there for an hour or two, watching the TV <br>We talk to him a bit, and then around ten o' clock, he'll go away again, and not come back until the next night <br>There's a lot of lanes and stuff around here, around the house although it's right in the middle of the city <br>it seems quite like the country, it's dead hidden safe I suppose, made for night living <br>There's a lot of squirrels and birds, and Stuart says he's seen about nine foxes there <br>when he's jumped over the fence on his way to Prior's Road <br>Sometimes you can go out walking, and when you've been out for a wee while even you don't know where you are anymore <br>so it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you <br>I suppose that's why he spends so much time there, that's why he's come to live there, or maybe it's just the squirrels <br>I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot <br>There's these two videos that we got for wedding presents called the e files <br>e files one and e files two about how Elvis is supposed to be still alive <br>And one time when he came round we were watching one of those, but he didn't say anything he just sat on the armchair <br>He was playing with his collar a bit, and we watched it right through and then when it finished <br>he just got up and walked off into the mist and didn't say anything <br>The first few times he came round I didn't speak to him at all, I wasn't really sure what to say <br>And Karen spoke to him quite a lot she seemed to know what to do more than I do <br>He had quite a strange manner though, he'd go into your stuff and look through it <br>then he'd maybe pick something up and play with it for a wee while, but he'd never make any comment about any of it <br>Seemed pretty rude to me <br>I just watched whatever Karen did, and listened to how she talked to him and then <br>after a while I started to copy that, and tell him a few things <br>not really bothered about whether he responded or said anything back or not <br>I think the first time I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine and I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen <br>and how it was that we'd come to be living there <br>I thought he probably liked the fact that we were living there because he came round so much <br>so I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about <br>We did it all over backwards, I told him <br>First of all we got to know each other, and then a while after that we met <br>and when we'd known each other for about seven years we decided to have an anniversary <br>and that went quite well, so after the anniversary we had a honeymoon, and that went well too <br>so after that we decided that we would get married <br>That's why we're living there now I used to think my dad was Elvis, but I haven't told him that yet <br>I haven't told my dad either </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Jeepster Singles Collection</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2016-11-03</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
