on a number and diggin' on the radio</br>Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line</br>I heard that highway start to whine</br>And I knew that left rear tire was about to go</br>Well the spare was flat and I got uptight</br>'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight</br>So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim</br>I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car</br>It was right in front of this little bar</br>A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn</br>Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat</br>And told the bartender that I had a flat</br>And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one</br>There was one thing I was sure proud to see</br>There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me</br>And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone</br>I called up the station down the road a ways</br>And he said he wasn't very busy t'day</br>And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so</br>He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother</br>Tellin' the durn fool</br>I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go</br>I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar</br>When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car</br>With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor</br>Well he looked at me and I damn near died</br>And I decided that I'd jus wait outside</br>So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door</br>Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin</br>These five big dude come strollin' in</br>With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth</br>An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one</br>Said you tip your hat to this lady son</br>An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath</br>Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight</br>In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night</br>'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me</br>Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick</br>And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick</br>So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee</br>He let out a yell that'd curl your hair</br>But before he could move I grabbed me a chair</br>And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man</br>Well you may not know it but this man's a spy</br>He's an undercover agent for the FBI</br>And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan</br>He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee</br>But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me</br>And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went</br>I said would you beleive this man has gone as far</br>As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars</br>And he voted for George McGoveren for president</br>Well he's a friend of them long haired hippie type pinko fags</br>I betcha he's even got a Commie flag</br>Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage</br>He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys</br>He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise</br>He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage</br>They all started lookin' real suspicious at him</br>And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim</br>You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life</br>I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch</br>And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church</br>And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife</br>Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed</br>But I didn't wait around to hear the rest</br>I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck</br>And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks</br>And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks</br>So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up</br>Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud</br>Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd</br>Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot</br>An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run</br>But somehow I couldn't resist the fun</br>Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot</br>Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas</br>And spun around and headed them off at the pass</br>Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air</br>Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'</br>Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'</br>But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there</br>When I hit the road I was really wheelin'</br>Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'</br>An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas</br>I think I'm gonna re route my trip</br>I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped</br>If I went to LA via Omaha<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Live At Gilleys (Live)</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 :
