(Live)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Charlie Daniels<br><br> I was takin' a trip out to LA <br>Toolin' along in my Chevrolet <br>Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio <br><br>Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line <br>I heard that highway start to whine <br>And I knew that left rear tire was about to go <br><br>Well the spare was flat and I got uptight <br>'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight <br>So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim <br><br>I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car <br>It was right in front of this little bar <br>A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn <br><br>Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat <br>And told the bartender that I had a flat <br>And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one <br><br>There was one thing I was sure proud to see <br>There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me <br>And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone <br><br>I called up the station down the road a ways <br>And he said he wasn't very busy t'day <br>And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so <br><br>He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother <br>Tellin' the durn fool <br>I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go <br><br>I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar <br>When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car <br>With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor <br><br>Well he looked at me and I damn near died <br>And I decided that I'd jus wait outside <br>So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door <br><br>Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin <br>These five big dude come strollin' in <br>With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth <br><br>An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one <br>Said you tip your hat to this lady son <br>An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath <br><br>Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight <br>In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night <br>'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me <br><br>Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick <br>And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick <br>So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee <br><br>He let out a yell that'd curl your hair <br>But before he could move I grabbed me a chair <br>And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man <br><br>Well you may not know it but this man's a spy <br>He's an undercover agent for the FBI <br>And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan <br><br>He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee <br>But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me <br>And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went <br><br>I said would you beleive this man has gone as far <br>As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars <br>And he voted for George McGoveren for president <br><br>Well he's a friend of them long haired hippie type pinko fags <br>I betcha he's even got a Commie flag <br>Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage <br><br>He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys <br>He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise <br>He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage <br><br>They all started lookin' real suspicious at him <br>And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim <br>You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life <br><br>I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch <br>And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church <br>And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife <br><br>Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed <br>But I didn't wait around to hear the rest <br>I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck <br><br>And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks <br>And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks <br>So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up <br><br>Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud <br>Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd <br>Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot <br><br>An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run <br>But somehow I couldn't resist the fun <br>Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot <br><br>Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas <br>And spun around and headed them off at the pass <br>Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air <br><br>Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin' <br>Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin' <br>But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there <br><br>When I hit the road I was really wheelin' <br>Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin' <br>An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas <br><br>I think I'm gonna re route my trip <br>I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped <br>If I went to LA via Omaha </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th
