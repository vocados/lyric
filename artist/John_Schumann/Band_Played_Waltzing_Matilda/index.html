</script><br> Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack <br>and I lived the free life of a rover <br>From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback <br>I waltzed my Matilda all over <br><br>Then in 1915, my country said son <br>It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done <br>So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun <br>and they marched me away to the war <br><br>And the band played Waltzing Matilda <br>as the ship pulled away from the quay <br>And amidst all the cheers, the flag waving and tears <br>we sailed off for Gallipoli <br><br>And how well I remember that terrible day <br>how our blood stained the sand and the water <br>And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay <br>we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter <br><br>Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well <br>He showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shell <br>And in ten minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell <br>Nearly blew us right back to Australia <br><br>But the band played Waltzing Matilda <br>When we stopped to bury our slain <br>We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs <br>And we started all over again <br><br>And those that were left, well we tried to survive <br>In that mad world of blood, death and fire <br>And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive <br>though around me the corpses piled higher <br><br>Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head <br>And when I woke up in my hospital bed <br>And saw what it had done, I wished I was dead <br>Never knew there was worse things than dyin' <br><br>For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda <br>all around the green bush far and free <br>To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs <br>No more waltzing Matilda for me <br><br>And so now every April, I sit on my porch <br>and I watch the parades pass before me <br>And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march <br>Reviving old dreams of past glories <br><br>And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore <br>They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war <br>And the young people ask, what are they marching for <br>And I ask myself the same question <br><br>But the band plays Waltzing Matilda <br>And the old men still answer the call <br>But as year follows year, more old men disappear <br>Soon no one will march there at all </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Behind The Lines (Expanded Edition)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2016-12-15</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
