<br>Scared to go back to Section <br>8 with my mama stressin' <br>30 shows a month and <br>I still won't buy me no Lexus <br>What is an advisor <br>Somebody that's holdin' <br>my checks <br>Just to fuck me over and <br>put my finances in debt <br>I read a case about Rihanna's <br>accountant and wondered <br>How did the bad girl feel <br>when she looked at them numbers <br>The type of shit'll <br>make me flip out <br>And just kill somethin' <br>drill somethin' <br>Get ill and fill ratchets <br>with a lil' somethin' <br>I practiced runnin' from fear <br>guess I had some good luck <br>At 27 years old <br>my biggest fear was bein' judged <br>How they look at me reflect <br>on myself my family my city <br>What they say 'bout me reveal <br>If my reputation would miss me <br>What they see from me <br>Would trickle down generations <br>in time <br>What they hear from me <br>Would make 'em highlight <br>my simplest lines <br>I'm talkin' fear <br>fear of losin' creativity <br>I'm talkin' fear <br>fear of missin' out on you and me <br>I'm talkin' fear <br>fear of losin' loyalty from pride <br>'Cause my DNA won't let me <br>involve in the light of God <br>I'm talkin' fear <br>fear that my humbleness is gone <br>I'm talkin' fear fear that love <br>ain't livin' here no more <br>I'm talkin' fear fear that it's <br>wickedness or weakness <br>Fear whatever it is <br>both is distinctive <br>Fear <br>what happens on Earth stays on Earth <br>And I can't take these <br>feelings with me <br>So hopefully they disperse <br>Within fourteen tracks <br>carried out over wax <br>Searchin' for resolutions <br>until somebody get back <br>Fear <br>what happens on Earth stays on Earth <br>And I can't take these <br>feelings with me <br>So hopefully they disperse <br>Within fourteen tracks <br>carried out over wax <br>Wonderin' if I'm livin' <br>through fear or livin' through rap <br>Damn <br>Goddamn you <br>Goddamn me <br>Goddamn us <br>Goddamn we <br>Goddamn us all <br>Verse two says
