Yoko Ono<br><br> Recorded live 3 june 1973 at the first international feminist conference, harvard university, cambridge, ma <br><br>While john is setting up the amp <br>What happened to me was that I was living as an artist and, who had relative freedom <br>As a woman and was considered the bitch in the society <br>Since I met john, I was upgraded into a witch and I wasand I think that that's very flattering <br>Anyway, what I learned from being with john is that the society solely treated me as a woman, as a woman who belonged to a man who is one of the most powerful people in our generation, and some of his closest friends told me that probably I should stay in the background, I should shut up, I should give up my work and that way I'll be happy <br>And I got those advises, I was luck, I was over thirty and it was too late for me to change <br>But still, still, this is one thing I want to say, sisters, because, with the wish that you know <br>You're not alone, ibecause the whole society started to attack me and the whole society wished me dead, I started accumulating a tremendous amount of guilt complex and in result of that I started to stutter and I consider myself a very eloquent woman and also an attractive woman all my life and suddenly, because I was associated to john, that was considered an ugly woman, ugly jap, who took your monument or something away from you <br>And that's when I realised how hard it is for woman, if I can start to stutter, being a strong woman and having lived thirty years by then, learn to stutter in three years of being treated as such, it is a very hard road <br>Now the next song is called coffin car and this is a song that I observed in myself and also in many sisters who are riding on coffin cars <br><br>Okay <br><br>Coffin car, she's riding a coffin car <br>She likes to ride a coffin car <br>People watching her with tender eyes <br>Friends whispering in kindly words <br>Children running, waving hands <br>Telling each other, how pretty she is <br><br>Coffin car, she's riding a coffin car <br>She likes to ride a coffin car <br>Friends making ways for the first time <br>People throwing kisses for the first time <br>Showering flowers, ringing bells <br>Telling each other, how nice she is <br><br>Coffin car, she likes to ride a coffin car <br>She's riding a coffin car <br>Wives showing tears for the first time <br>Husbands taking their hats off for the first time <br>Crushing their handkerchiefs, rubbing their nose <br>Telling each other, how good she is <br><br>Half the world is dead anyway <br>The other half is asleep <br>And life is killing her <br>Telling her to join the dead <br><br>So ev'ry day, she likes to ride a coffin car <br>A flower covered coffin car <br>Pretending she was dead <br><br>Coffin car <br>A flower covered coffin car <br>A flower covered coffin car <br>A flower covered coffin car </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Feeling The Space</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-07-14</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rock</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
