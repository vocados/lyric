</script><br> Had your number on speed dial You never answered when I reached out I looked left (see I looked to the left) I looked right (and to the right) But you weren't there Where the hell, where the hell were you? 24/7 you'd be there for me No matter what happened, you'd care for me I looked up (see I looked to the sky) I looked down (and to the ground) But you weren't there Where the hell, where the hell were you? Oh, am I missing something? Is the network down In your part of town? (We couldn't get through to ya) You didn't hear the phone ring Cause you're in a crowd And you're busy now Where were you in the middle when this all went down? Where were you at the bitter end? (You said you'd be there) You're a fair-weather lover, yes I understand Where were you when I needed a friend? Where the hell, where the hell were you? (You said you'd be there) Where the hell, where the hell were you? (3, 2, 1) Look, see I know what you run But don't think you can come and go when you want Cause one minute you was here, one minute you was there But then the next minute you were gone (gone) Please, I see you in it for the bling You in it for the money, in it for the cha ching Sorry babe, but I ain't giving you a ring In fact I ain't giving you a thing, where you've been Am I loosing my mind? Say you're ill in bed, huh Not what your Facebook said (Said we seen that) Am I wasting my time? If you're really gone, why am I holding on Where were you in the middle when this all went down? Where were you at the bitter end? (You said you'd be there) You're a fair-weather lover, yes I understand Where were you when I needed a friend Where the hell, where the hell were you? (Where were you?) Where the hell, where the hell were you? Am I missing something? Is the network down In your part of town? (We couldn't get through to ya) You didn't hear the phone ring Cause you're in a crowd And you're busy now Where were you in the middle when it all went down? Where were you at the bitter end? (You said you'd be there) You're a fair-weather lover, that I understand Where were you when I needed a friend? (I'm gonna find you anyway) All the lights, all the promises and all the love All the money and the time that I spend You're a fair-weather lover, yes I understand Where were you when I needed a friend? Where the hell, where the hell were you? Where the hell, where the hell were you? Come and see me baby Where the hell, where the hell were you? somebody tell me baby Where the hell, where the hell were you? Where the hell, where the hell were you?
