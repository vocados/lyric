can slip into an abyss</br>No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'</br>Ego in charge of every move, he's a star</br>And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts</br>He's fallin' apart, but we deny it</br>Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it</br>When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately</br>It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately</br>There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe</br>That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take</br>'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he</br>The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake</br>The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men</br>Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him</br>So he grows out of control</br>Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show</br>Damn, wonder what happened</br>Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas</br>Based off the words they be rappin'</br>But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit</br>Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit</br>Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself</br>Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help</br>While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it</br>Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it</br>False prophets</br>Somebody

the acclaim, the respect that's been had</br>By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'</br>Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'</br>And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings</br>Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga</br>And a platform to make a classic rap song</br>To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life</br>Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it</br>I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it</br>But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great</br>Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late</br>Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication</br>That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred</br>Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me</br>Do I want these niggas to worship me</br>False prophets</br>Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this</br>Be like this, be like this</br>Somebody

shoulda told me it would be like this</br>Yeah, false prophets</br>These rappers insecure</br>They talk about being a man so much</br>I finally understand that they ain't even sure</br>'Bout who they are and why they do this</br>Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory</br>My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories</br>I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write</br>Songs that raise the hair on my arms</br>My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard</br>To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on</br>Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out</br>I care nothin' 'bout opinions</br>I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in</br>Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish</br>This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit</br>I'm on some thankful shit</br>But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'</br>I hear my old shit and know I can top it</br>False prophets</br>Somebody
