ways</br>They came here seekin' freedom</br>Then they end up ownin' slaves</br>Justified it usin' Christianity which saves</br>Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way</br>That's why ISIS is a crisis</br>But in reality this country do the same shit</br>Take a life and call it righteous</br>Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly</br>In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'</br>These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action</br>They read the headline and then they all started clappin'</br>As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer</br>I stood there for a second, watched them high five each other</br>For real I thought this was Thou shalt not kill</br>But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville</br>Claimin' that he reached for a gun</br>They really think we dumb and got a death wish</br>Now somebody's son is layin' breathless</br>When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas</br>Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus</br>Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas</br>Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice</br>Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'</br>Just like they was back home, and that's wrong</br>So now it's Fuck the government</br>They see my niggas strugglin'</br>And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah</br>The type of shit that make you wanna</br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go</br>The type of shit that make you wanna</br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go</br>I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him</br>Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him</br>Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks</br>Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke</br>Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question</br>Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression</br>And if so, if you got all the power in the clout</br>As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out</br>Well, I didn't say nigga, but you catch my drift</br>He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift</br>He broke the issues down and showed me he was well aware</br>I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared</br>But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up</br>He said, There's things that I wanna fix</br>But you know this shit, nigga politics</br>Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'</br>You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it</br>Change is slow, always has been, always will be</br>But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me</br>Change is slow, always has been, always will be</br>But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me feel me</br>The type of shit that make you wanna Aight, third verse</br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go</br>The type of shit that make you wanna</br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go</br>Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart</br>Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart</br>See, the people at the top, they get to do just what they want</br>'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart</br>Then they start to holla Revolution</br>Tired of livin' here, destitution</br>Fuck that lootin' Can you tell me what's the best solution</br>I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see</br>If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed</br>But see, it's not that simple</br>I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature</br>While this instrumental played</br>Then I realized somethin' that made</br>Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way</br>Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say</br>Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way</br>The children in abusive households grow up</br>Knockin' girlfriends out cold that's called a cycle</br>Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go</br>So understand</br>You get the power, but you know what power does to man</br>Corruption always leads us to the same shit again</br>So when you talk 'bout revolution</br>Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'</br>What good is takin' over</br>When we know what you gon' do</br>The only real revolution happens right inside of you</br>I said, what good is takin' over</br>When we know what you gon' do</br>The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga</br>The type of shit that make you wanna High for hours, nigga</br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go Volume one</br>The
