</script><br> This is called being high as shit, for hours <br>That's the name of this song, nigga <br>High as Shit for Hours <br>Here we go, yeah <br><br>American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways <br>They came here seekin' freedom <br>Then they end up ownin' slaves <br>Justified it usin' Christianity which saves <br>Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way <br>That's why ISIS is a crisis <br>But in reality this country do the same shit <br>Take a life and call it righteous <br>Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly <br>In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin' <br>These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action <br>They read the headline and then they all started clappin' <br>As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer <br>I stood there for a second, watched them high five each other <br>For real I thought this was Thou shalt not kill <br>But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville <br>Claimin' that he reached for a gun <br>They really think we dumb and got a death wish <br>Now somebody's son is layin' breathless <br>When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas <br>Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus <br>Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas <br>Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice <br>Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin' <br>Just like they was back home, and that's wrong <br>So now it's Fuck the government <br>They see my niggas strugglin' <br>And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah <br><br>The type of shit that make you wanna <br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go <br>The type of shit that make you wanna <br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go <br><br>I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him <br>Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him <br>Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks <br>Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke <br>Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question <br>Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression <br>And if so, if you got all the power in the clout <br>As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out <br>Well, I didn't say nigga, but you catch my drift <br>He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift <br>He broke the issues down and showed me he was well aware <br>I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared <br>But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up <br>He said, There's things that I wanna fix <br>But you know this shit, nigga politics <br>Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin' <br>You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it <br>Change is slow, always has been, always will be <br>But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me <br>Change is slow, always has been, always will be <br>But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me feel me <br><br>The type of shit that make you wanna Aight, third verse <br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go <br>The type of shit that make you wanna <br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go <br><br>Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart <br>Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart <br>See, the people at the top, they get to do just what they want <br>'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart <br>Then they start to holla Revolution <br>Tired of livin' here, destitution <br>Fuck that lootin' Can you tell me what's the best solution <br>I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see <br>If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed <br>But see, it's not that simple <br>I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature <br>While this instrumental played <br>Then I realized somethin' that made <br>Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way <br>Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say <br>Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way <br>The children in abusive households grow up <br>Knockin' girlfriends out cold that's called a cycle <br>Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go <br>So understand <br>You get the power, but you know what power does to man <br>Corruption always leads us to the same shit again <br>So when you talk 'bout revolution <br>Dawg, I hear just what you sayin' <br>What good is takin' over <br>When we know what you gon' do <br>The only real revolution happens right inside of you <br>I said, what good is takin' over <br>When we know what you gon' do <br>The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga <br><br>The type of shit that make you wanna High for hours, nigga <br>The type of shit that make you wanna let go Volume one <br>The type of shit that make you wanna <br>The type
