</script><br> Yeah <br>For your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>For your eyes only <br>for your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>For your eyes only <br>Hey niggas be dying <br>on the daily <br>It seems my dreams faded <br>for far too long <br>The consequences deadly <br>Can't visualize myself <br>as nothing but a criminal <br>Control the block <br>serving up rocks <br>and stay subliminal <br>'Cause young niggas <br>is hardheaded <br>they letting off <br>Full of adrenaline <br>ignorant to what death can cause <br>Ain't no coming back <br>family dressed in black <br>Plus it's hot now <br>the cops outside <br>it's hard to flip a pack <br>And my daughter gotta eat <br>her mama be stressing me <br>Like I ain't the one <br>who put them Jays on her feet <br>Like I ain't out <br>in the field like that <br>I might be low for the moment <br>but I will bounce back <br>Despite the charges <br>back to the wall <br>I fight regardless <br>Screaming Fuck the law <br>my life is lawless <br>That's what you call it <br>ain't got to be no psychic <br>To see this is like <br>the farthest thing from heaven <br>This is hell and I don't mean <br>that hyperbolic <br>I try to find employment even <br>if it's wiping toilets <br>But these felonies <br>be making life the hardest <br>Resisting the temptation to run up <br>and swipe a wallet <br>Or run up on your yard <br>snatch your daughter bike <br>and pawn it <br>That's why I write this sonnet <br>If the pressure get too much <br>for me to take and I break <br>Play this tape for my daughter <br>and let her know my life is on it <br>For your eyes <br>Let her know my life is on it <br>For your eyes <br>For your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes only <br>You probably grown now <br>so this song'll hit you <br>If you're hearing this <br>unfortunately <br>Means that I'm no longer <br>with you in the physical <br>Not even sure <br>if I believe in God <br>but because you still alive <br>He got me praying <br>that the spiritual is real <br>So I can be a part of you still <br>my pops was killed too <br>So I know how part of you feels <br>Maybe you hate me <br>maybe you miss me <br>maybe you spite me <br>Life goes in cycles <br>maybe you'll date a nigga <br>just like me <br>I hope not <br>I'm tired of dope spots <br>And fiends that smoke rocks <br>I've seen far too many <br>niggas' hopes rot <br>I'm writing this because me <br>and the devil had a dance <br>Now I see death around the corner <br>'pologizing in advance <br>Don't know <br>if I ever had a chance <br>at a glance I'm a failure <br>Addicted to pushing paraphernalia <br>But Daddy had dreams once <br>my eyes had a gleam once <br>Innocence disappeared <br>by the age of eight years <br>My Pops shot up <br>drug related mama addicted <br>So Granny raised me in projects <br>where thugs was hanging <br>Blood was staining the concrete <br>Older niggas I loved talked <br>like they was above <br>Maintaining a time sheet <br>that slow money <br>Picked up the family business <br>by the age of thirteen <br>Six years later was handed <br>sentence <br>'Round the same time is <br>when you came in this world <br>Me and your mama thinking <br>What the fuck we naming this girl <br>I told her Nina <br>the prettiest name <br>that I could think of <br>For the prettiest thing <br>my eyes had ever seen <br>I was nineteen <br>Took me two felonies <br>to see the trap <br>This crooked ass <br>system set for me <br>And now I fear it's too late <br>for me to ever be <br>The one that set examples <br>that was never set for me <br>I'm living fast <br>but not fast enough <br>Cause karma keeps <br>on catching up to me <br>And if my past becomes <br>the death of me <br>I hope you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand me <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes only <br>It's several ways <br>I could've went out <br>too many to count <br>Was it the trigger happy crackers <br>that the badges give clout <br>Was it the young niggas <br>blasting frustrated <br>Cause the cash running out <br>Niggas don't know <br>how to act in a drought <br>See baby girl <br>I realized <br>My definition of <br>a real nigga was skewed <br>My views misshaped <br>by new mixtapes <br>That confirmed the shit <br>I learned in the streets was true <br>That real niggas don't speak <br>when they beef with you <br>They just pull up <br>on your street <br>let the heat achoo <br>And if a real nigga hungry <br>he gon' eat your food <br>I was a fool <br>spent all my time ducking school <br>ducking cops <br>Ducking rules <br>hugging blocks <br>that don't love you <br>I pray you find a nigga <br>with goals and point of views <br>Much broader than the corner <br>if not it's gon' corner you <br>Into a box <br>where your son don't even <br>know his pops <br>And the cyclical nature <br>of doing time continues <br>My worst fear is one day <br>that you come home <br>from school <br>And see your father face <br>while hearing <br>'bout tragedy on news <br>I got the strangest <br>feeling your daddy <br>gonna lose his life soon <br>And sadly <br>if you're listening now <br>it must mean it's true <br>But maybe there's <br>a chance that it's not <br>And this album remains locked <br>In a hard drive <br>like valuable jewels <br>And I can teach you <br>this in person <br>Like I'm teaching you <br>to tie your own shoes <br>I love you and I hope <br>to God I don't lose you <br>For your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>for your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>for your eyes only <br>For your eyes <br>do you understand <br>For your eyes only <br>One day your daddy called me <br>told me he had a funny feeling <br>What he'd been dealing <br>with lately <br>he wasn't telling <br>I tried to pick his brains <br>still he wasn't revealing <br>But I could feel the sense <br>of panic in his voice <br>And it was chilling he said <br>Jermaine I knew you <br>since we was children <br>I never asked for nothing <br>when times was hard <br>I never had discussions <br>with you begging you to help me <br>I dealt with the repercussions <br>of my actions <br>I know you tried to steer me <br>'way from that shit <br>But that shit was in my blood <br>you know my life <br>I know your Momma <br>nigga send my love <br>In case I never get a chance <br>to speak again <br>I won't forget the weekends <br>spent sleeping at your crib <br>That's the way <br>I wished my family lived <br>But my granny crib <br>was in the 'jects <br>I had to interject like <br>Nigga what you talking 'bout <br>Fuck is you getting at <br>He said Listen <br>I got no time to dive <br>into descriptions <br>But I've been having premonitions <br>Just call it visions <br>from the other side <br>I got a feeling <br>I won't see tomorrow <br>Like the time <br>I'm living on is borrowed <br>With that said <br>the only thing I'm proud to say <br>I was a father <br>Write my story down <br>and if I pass <br>Go play it for my daughter <br>when she ready <br>And so I'm leaving you this record <br>for your eyes only <br>Don't you ever scratch <br>or disrespect it <br>This perspective is a real one <br>another lost 'Ville son <br>I dedicate these words to you <br>and all the other children <br>Affected by the mass incarceration <br>in this nation <br>That sent your pops to prison <br>when he needed education <br>Sometimes I think <br>that segregation <br>would've done us better <br>Although I know that means <br>that I would never <br>Be brought into this world <br>cause my daddy was so thrilled <br>When he found him a white girl <br>to take back to Jonesboro <br>With 'lil Zach and Cole World <br>barely one years old <br>Now it's thirty years later <br>making sure this story's told <br>Girl your daddy was a real nigga <br>not cause he was cold <br>Not because he was the first <br>To get some pussy twelve years old <br>Not because he used to come through <br>In the Caddy on some vogues <br>Not because he went from bagging up <br>Them grams to serving O's <br>Nah your daddy was a real nigga <br>not 'cause he was hard <br>Not because he lived a life of crime <br>and sat behind some bars <br>Not because he screamed <br>Fuck the law <br>Although that was true <br>Your daddy was a real nigga <br>cause he loved you <br>For your eyes only <br></p><table class="table
