</script> <p>Yeah</br>For your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>For your eyes only</br>for your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>For your eyes only</br>Hey niggas be dying</br>on the daily</br>It seems my dreams faded</br>for far too long</br>The consequences deadly</br>Can't visualize myself</br>as nothing but a criminal</br>Control the block</br>serving up rocks</br>and stay subliminal</br>'Cause young niggas</br>is hardheaded</br>they letting off</br>Full of adrenaline</br>ignorant to what death can cause</br>Ain't no coming back</br>family dressed in black</br>Plus it's hot now</br>the cops outside</br>it's hard to flip a pack</br>And my daughter gotta eat</br>her mama be stressing me</br>Like I ain't the one</br>who put them Jays on her feet</br>Like I ain't out</br>in the field like that</br>I might be low for the moment</br>but I will bounce back</br>Despite the charges</br>back to the wall</br>I fight regardless</br>Screaming Fuck the law</br>my life is lawless</br>That's what you call it</br>ain't got to be no psychic</br>To see this is like</br>the farthest thing from heaven</br>This is hell and I don't mean</br>that hyperbolic</br>I try to find employment even</br>if it's wiping toilets</br>But these felonies</br>be making life the hardest</br>Resisting the temptation to run up</br>and swipe a wallet</br>Or run up on your yard</br>snatch your daughter bike</br>and pawn it</br>That's why I write this sonnet</br>If the pressure get too much</br>for me to take and I break</br>Play this tape for my daughter</br>and let her know my life is on it</br>For your eyes</br>Let her know my life is on it</br>For your eyes</br>For your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes only</br>You probably grown now</br>so this song'll hit you</br>If you're hearing this</br>unfortunately</br>Means that I'm no longer</br>with you in the physical</br>Not even sure</br>if I believe in God</br>but because you still alive</br>He got me praying</br>that the spiritual is real</br>So I can be a part of you still</br>my pops was killed too</br>So I know how part of you feels</br>Maybe you hate me</br>maybe you miss me</br>maybe you spite me</br>Life goes in cycles</br>maybe you'll date a nigga</br>just like me</br>I hope not</br>I'm tired of dope spots</br>And fiends that smoke rocks</br>I've seen far too many</br>niggas' hopes rot</br>I'm writing this because me</br>and the devil had a dance</br>Now I see death around the corner</br>'pologizing in advance</br>Don't know</br>if I ever had a chance</br>at a glance I'm a failure</br>Addicted to pushing paraphernalia</br>But Daddy had dreams once</br>my eyes had a gleam once</br>Innocence disappeared</br>by the age of eight years</br>My Pops shot up</br>drug related mama addicted</br>So Granny raised me in projects</br>where thugs was hanging</br>Blood was staining the concrete</br>Older niggas I loved talked</br>like they was above</br>Maintaining a time sheet</br>that slow money</br>Picked up the family business</br>by the age of thirteen</br>Six years later was handed</br>sentence</br>'Round the same time is</br>when you came in this world</br>Me and your mama thinking</br>What the fuck we naming this girl</br>I told her Nina</br>the prettiest name</br>that I could think of</br>For the prettiest thing</br>my eyes had ever seen</br>I was nineteen</br>Took me two felonies</br>to see the trap</br>This crooked ass</br>system set for me</br>And now I fear it's too late</br>for me to ever be</br>The one that set examples</br>that was never set for me</br>I'm living fast</br>but not fast enough</br>Cause karma keeps</br>on catching up to me</br>And if my past becomes</br>the death of me</br>I hope you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand me</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes only</br>It's several ways</br>I could've went out</br>too many to count</br>Was it the trigger happy crackers</br>that the badges give clout</br>Was it the young niggas</br>blasting frustrated</br>Cause the cash running out</br>Niggas don't know</br>how to act in a drought</br>See baby girl</br>I realized</br>My definition of</br>a real nigga was skewed</br>My views misshaped</br>by new mixtapes</br>That confirmed the shit</br>I learned in the streets was true</br>That real niggas don't speak</br>when they beef with you</br>They just pull up</br>on your street</br>let the heat achoo</br>And if a real nigga hungry</br>he gon' eat your food</br>I was a fool</br>spent all my time ducking school</br>ducking cops</br>Ducking rules</br>hugging blocks</br>that don't love you</br>I pray you find a nigga</br>with goals and point of views</br>Much broader than the corner</br>if not it's gon' corner you</br>Into a box</br>where your son don't even</br>know his pops</br>And the cyclical nature</br>of doing time continues</br>My worst fear is one day</br>that you come home</br>from school</br>And see your father face</br>while hearing</br>'bout tragedy on news</br>I got the strangest</br>feeling your daddy</br>gonna lose his life soon</br>And sadly</br>if you're listening now</br>it must mean it's true</br>But maybe there's</br>a chance that it's not</br>And this album remains locked</br>In a hard drive</br>like valuable jewels</br>And I can teach you</br>this in person</br>Like I'm teaching you</br>to tie your own shoes</br>I love you and I hope</br>to God I don't lose you</br>For your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>for your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>for your eyes only</br>For your eyes</br>do you understand</br>For your eyes only</br>One day your daddy called me</br>told me he had a funny feeling</br>What he'd been dealing</br>with lately</br>he wasn't telling</br>I tried to pick his brains</br>still he wasn't revealing</br>But I could feel the sense</br>of panic in his voice</br>And it was chilling he said</br>Jermaine I knew you</br>since we was children</br>I never asked for nothing</br>when times was hard</br>I never had discussions</br>with you begging you to help me</br>I dealt with the repercussions</br>of my actions</br>I know you tried to steer me</br>'way from that shit</br>But that shit was in my blood</br>you know my life</br>I know your Momma</br>nigga send my love</br>In case I never get a chance</br>to speak again</br>I won't forget the weekends</br>spent sleeping at your crib</br>That's the way</br>I wished my family lived</br>But my granny crib</br>was in the 'jects</br>I had to interject like</br>Nigga what you talking 'bout</br>Fuck is you getting at</br>He said Listen</br>I got no time to dive</br>into descriptions</br>But I've been having premonitions</br>Just call it visions</br>from the other side</br>I got a feeling</br>I won't see tomorrow</br>Like the time</br>I'm living on is borrowed</br>With that said</br>the only thing I'm proud to say</br>I was a father</br>Write my story down</br>and if I pass</br>Go play it for my daughter</br>when she ready</br>And so I'm leaving you this record</br>for your eyes only</br>Don't you ever scratch</br>or disrespect it</br>This perspective is a real one</br>another lost 'Ville son</br>I dedicate these words to you</br>and all the other children</br>Affected by the mass incarceration</br>in this nation</br>That sent your pops to prison</br>when he needed education</br>Sometimes I think</br>that segregation</br>would've done us better</br>Although I know that means</br>that I would never</br>Be brought into this world</br>cause my daddy was so thrilled</br>When he found him a white girl</br>to take back to Jonesboro</br>With 'lil Zach and Cole World</br>barely one years old</br>Now it's thirty years later</br>making sure this story's told</br>Girl your daddy was a real nigga</br>not cause he was cold</br>Not because he was the first</br>To get some pussy twelve years old</br>Not because he used to come through</br>In the Caddy on some vogues</br>Not because he went from bagging up</br>Them grams to serving O's</br>Nah your daddy was a real nigga</br>not 'cause he was hard</br>Not because he lived a life of crime</br>and sat behind some bars</br>Not because he screamed</br>Fuck the law</br>Although that was true</br>Your daddy was a real nigga</br>cause he loved you</br>For your eyes only<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : 4 Your Eyez Only</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2016-12-13</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap
