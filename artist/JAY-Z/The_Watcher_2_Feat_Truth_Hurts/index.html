</script><br> Things just ain't the same for gangstas <br>But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters <br>All of these rap singers claimin' they bangers <br>Doing all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers <br>Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners <br>I was doing this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers <br>I was moving them grams <br>Before you knew what a hand-to-hand was <br>Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners <br>Before you knew what hard white or tan was <br>I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bama's <br>I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers <br>I was pricking my finger before you knew what a Fam was <br>I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was <br>300 mil later, now you understand us <br>Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas <br>You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night <br>Grand fucked up one fight, I was on the Peter Pan bus <br>You was putting Peter Pan up in your room <br>Y'all fucking with whom Allow me to retort <br>You cowards is just now learning the shit that we taught <br>You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report <br>About a high speed Porsche, ie <br>You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door <br>Like Eric B for Pres, respect me in this bitch <br>You can't disrespect us, 'cause you got a little check cut <br>You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your little neck up <br>Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches <br>You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous <br>I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game <br>It's only right I got the right to be king <br>Niggas that got life really like what I sing <br>'Cause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain <br>Know the shit I don't write be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game <br>Word to the hyphen in my name J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa <br>The past, present, nigga the future, proper <br>The holy trinity of hip-hop is us <br>We give Dre his props but that's where it stops, it's the Roc <br><br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me <br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me <br>You try, but what you think you saw <br>Ain't what you thought you saw <br>You better off not looking at all <br>Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before <br>People I used to know just don't know me no more <br>But everywhere that I go, I got people I know <br>Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low <br><br>I'm still on top of the game <br>Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim <br>Still at the top, had to rock for the fame <br>Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came <br>You seen it all, how I got, how I gained <br>The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain <br>When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim <br>The streets, they made a special spot for my name <br>Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign <br>But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins <br>The pride and the pain <br>All the way back from the rise of my name <br>See the world clear through the eyes of the mane <br>See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave <br>When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane <br>The eyes that I played <br>The best to emerge in the game is the Watcher <br><br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me <br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me <br>You try, but what you think you saw <br>Ain't what you thought you saw <br>You better off not looking at all <br>Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before <br>People I used to know just don't know me no more <br>But everywhere that I go, I got people I know <br>Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low <br><br>I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs <br>It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends <br>It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen <br>Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene <br>Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket <br>Some take the crack and chop it <br>But those that haven't got it take away the added profit <br>It's catastrophic I take the gat and cock it <br>And I'll sit back and watch it <br>These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully <br>The world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me <br>Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny <br>In the place where the number one cause of death is money <br>You can try copin' <br>I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken <br>I'm still alive and scopin' <br>Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in <br>And I'ma die with my eyes open, the Watcher <br><br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me <br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me <br>You try, but what you think you saw <br>Ain't what you thought
