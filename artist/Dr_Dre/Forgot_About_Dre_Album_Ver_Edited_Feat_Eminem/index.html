skis</br>Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford</br>To provide my family with groceries</br>Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks</br>To add to the wall full of plaques</br>Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies</br>Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze Ho please</br>You better bow down on both knees</br>Who you think taught you to smoke trees</br>Who you think brought you the oldies</br>Eazy E's, Ice Cubes, and DOC's, the Snoop D O double G's</br>And the group that said Mothafuck the police</br>Gave you a tape full of dope beats</br>To bump when you stroll through in your hood</br>And when your album sales wasn't doing too good</br>Who's the Doctor they told you to go see</br>Y'all better listen up closely</br>All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped</br>Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep</br>So fuck y'all, all of y'all If y'all don't like me, blow me</br>Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me</br>And turn me back to the old me</br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk</br>Like they got somethin' to say</br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips</br>Just a bunch of gibberish</br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre</br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk</br>Like they got somethin' to say</br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips</br>Just a bunch of gibberish</br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre</br>So what do you say to somebody you hate</br>Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way</br>Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way</br>Just study a tape of NWA</br>One day I was walking by</br>With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy</br>Give me an awkward eye</br>And I strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani</br>I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not</br>I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge</br>When I'm drunk as fuck</br>Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage</br>Hoppin' out with two broken legs, trying to walk it off</br>Fuck you too, bitch Call the cops</br>I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barking dogs</br>And when the cops came through</br>Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house</br>With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches</br>And still weren't found out Right here</br>From here on out, it's the Chronic II</br>Starting today and tomorrow's anew</br>And I'm still loco enough</br>To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew</br>Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies</br>In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up</br>When the temp goes up to the mid 80s</br>Callin' men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy</br>There's no way that you can save me</br>It's okay, go with him, Hailie Dada</br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk</br>Like they got somethin' to say</br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips</br>Just a bunch of gibberish</br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre</br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk</br>Like

motherfuckers would stop coming up to me</br>with your hands out, looking up to me</br>Like you want somethin' free</br>When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me</br>But now that I got this little company</br>Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease</br>But you won't get a crumb from me</br>'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton</br>I told 'em all, all them little gangstas</br>Who you think helped mold 'em all</br>Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns</br>Like I ain't got none what, you think I sold 'em all</br>'Cause I stay well off</br>Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off</br>What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad</br>Tryin' to get this damn label off</br>I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath</br>It ain't gonna be nothin' after that</br>So give me one more platinum plaque</br>And fuck rap, you can have it back</br>So where's all the Mad Rappers at</br>It's like a jungle in this habitat</br>But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats</br>While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch</br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk</br>Like they got somethin' to say</br>But nothin' comes out when
