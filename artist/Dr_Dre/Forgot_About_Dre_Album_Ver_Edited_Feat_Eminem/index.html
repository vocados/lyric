</script><br> Y'all know me, still the same OG, but I been low key <br>Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese <br>No deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys <br>No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis <br>Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford <br>To provide my family with groceries <br>Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks <br>To add to the wall full of plaques <br>Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies <br>Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze Ho please <br>You better bow down on both knees <br>Who you think taught you to smoke trees <br>Who you think brought you the oldies <br>Eazy E's, Ice Cubes, and DOC's, the Snoop D O double G's <br>And the group that said Mothafuck the police <br>Gave you a tape full of dope beats <br>To bump when you stroll through in your hood <br>And when your album sales wasn't doing too good <br>Who's the Doctor they told you to go see <br>Y'all better listen up closely <br>All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped <br>Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep <br>So fuck y'all, all of y'all If y'all don't like me, blow me <br>Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me <br>And turn me back to the old me <br><br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk <br>Like they got somethin' to say <br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips <br>Just a bunch of gibberish <br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre <br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk <br>Like they got somethin' to say <br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips <br>Just a bunch of gibberish <br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre <br><br>So what do you say to somebody you hate <br>Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way <br>Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way <br>Just study a tape of NWA <br>One day I was walking by <br>With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy <br>Give me an awkward eye <br>And I strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani <br>I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not <br>I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge <br>When I'm drunk as fuck <br>Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage <br>Hoppin' out with two broken legs, trying to walk it off <br>Fuck you too, bitch Call the cops <br>I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barking dogs <br>And when the cops came through <br>Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house <br>With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches <br>And still weren't found out Right here <br>From here on out, it's the Chronic II <br>Starting today and tomorrow's anew <br>And I'm still loco enough <br>To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew <br>Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies <br>In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up <br>When the temp goes up to the mid 80s <br>Callin' men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy <br>There's no way that you can save me <br>It's okay, go with him, Hailie Dada <br><br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk <br>Like they got somethin' to say <br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips <br>Just a bunch of gibberish <br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre <br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk <br>Like they got somethin' to say <br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips <br>Just a bunch of gibberish <br>And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre <br><br>If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me <br>with your hands out, looking up to me <br>Like you want somethin' free <br>When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me <br>But now that I got this little company <br>Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease <br>But you won't get a crumb from me <br>'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton <br>I told 'em all, all them little gangstas <br>Who you think helped mold 'em all <br>Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns <br>Like I ain't got none what, you think I sold 'em all <br>'Cause I stay well off <br>Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off <br>What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad <br>Tryin' to get this damn label off <br>I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath <br>It ain't gonna be nothin' after that <br>So give me one more platinum plaque <br>And fuck rap, you can have it back <br>So where's all the Mad Rappers at <br>It's like a jungle in this habitat <br>But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats <br>While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch <br><br>Nowadays, everybody wanna talk <br>Like they got somethin' to say <br>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips <br>Just a
