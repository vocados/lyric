</script> <p>What's the difference between me and you</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo</br>I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals</br>Got the pens and pencils</br>Got down to business, but sometimes</br>The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you</br>But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you</br>I still remember the window of the car that you went through</br>That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through</br>And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you</br>Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu</br>Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you and that's just being real wit'chu</br>You see the truth is</br>Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is</br>And who I'm still cool with</br>Then I got these fake ass niggas I first blew with</br>Claimin' that they non violent, talkin' like they voice sample</br>Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions</br>Move units, then talk shit and we can do this</br>Until then I ain't even speaking your name</br>Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga</br>It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors</br>It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em</br>That's the difference</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it</br>Never knew about the next level until Dre did it yeah</br>I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby sitted</br>I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick yeah</br>Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions</br>I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catching feelings</br>So what the fuck am I supposed to do</br>I pop bottles and hot hollow points at each and all of you c'mon</br>A heartless bastard, high and plastered</br>My style is like the reaction from too much acid</br>Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it</br>Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates</br>What's the difference between me and you what</br>About five bank accounts</br>Three ounces and two vehicles</br>Until my death, I'm Bangladesh</br>I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left</br>Yo that's the difference</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>Aight, hold up, hold up</br>Stop the beat a minute</br>I got somethin' to say</br>Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now</br>While this fucking weed is in me</br>What the fuck</br>I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg</br>I got your motherfucking back Right just know this shit</br>Slim, I don't know if you noticed it</br>But I've had your back from day one, nigga</br>Let's blow this bitch</br>I mean it dawg</br>You ever need somebody offed</br>Whose throat is it</br>Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch</br>I'll show you where the ocean is</br>Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer</br>But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma</br>I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her</br>And cruise around with her for seven hours through California</br>And have her wavin' at people, hi, then drop her off on the corner</br>At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her</br>Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off, drop the sawed off</br>And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of</br>Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up</br>Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up</br>In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water</br>That's for trying to talk like The Chronic was lost product</br>That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up</br>You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up</br>So what's the difference between us We can start at the penis</br>Or we can scream I just don't give a fuck and see who means it</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>What's the difference between me and you</br>You talk a good one</br>But you don't do what you supposed to do</br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions</br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting</br>What's the difference
