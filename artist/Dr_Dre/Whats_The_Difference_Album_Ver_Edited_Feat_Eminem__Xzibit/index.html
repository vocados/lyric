(Edited) (Feat. Eminem & Xzibit)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Dr. Dre<br><br> What's the difference between me and you <br>What's the difference between me and you <br><br>Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo <br>I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals <br>Got the pens and pencils <br>Got down to business, but sometimes <br>The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you <br>But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you <br>I still remember the window of the car that you went through <br>That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through <br>And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you <br>Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu <br>Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you and that's just being real wit'chu <br>You see the truth is <br>Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is <br>And who I'm still cool with <br>Then I got these fake ass niggas I first blew with <br>Claimin' that they non violent, talkin' like they voice sample <br>Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions <br>Move units, then talk shit and we can do this <br>Until then I ain't even speaking your name <br>Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga <br>It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors <br>It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em <br>That's the difference <br><br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br><br>Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it <br>Never knew about the next level until Dre did it yeah <br>I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby sitted <br>I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick yeah <br>Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions <br>I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catching feelings <br>So what the fuck am I supposed to do <br>I pop bottles and hot hollow points at each and all of you c'mon <br>A heartless bastard, high and plastered <br>My style is like the reaction from too much acid <br>Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it <br>Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates <br>What's the difference between me and you what <br>About five bank accounts <br>Three ounces and two vehicles <br>Until my death, I'm Bangladesh <br>I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left <br>Yo that's the difference <br><br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br><br>Aight, hold up, hold up <br>Stop the beat a minute <br>I got somethin' to say <br>Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now <br>While this fucking weed is in me <br>What the fuck <br>I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg <br>I got your motherfucking back Right just know this shit <br>Slim, I don't know if you noticed it <br>But I've had your back from day one, nigga <br>Let's blow this bitch <br>I mean it dawg <br>You ever need somebody offed <br>Whose throat is it <br>Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch <br>I'll show you where the ocean is <br>Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer <br>But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma <br>I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her <br>And cruise around with her for seven hours through California <br>And have her wavin' at people, hi, then drop her off on the corner <br>At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her <br>Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off, drop the sawed off <br>And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of <br>Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up <br>Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up <br>In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water <br>That's for trying to talk like The Chronic was lost product <br>That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up <br>You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up <br>So what's the difference between us We can start at the penis <br>Or we can scream I just don't give a fuck and see who means it <br><br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br>What's the difference between me and you <br>You talk a good one <br>But you don't do what you supposed to do <br>I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions <br>I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting <br><br>What's the difference between me and you </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>2001 (Edited
