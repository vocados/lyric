</script><br> So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want <br>The sun is shining and your lovers always lose you in the dark <br>And they were all chosen to remember how the sparrows hit the window <br>That you closed to keep the cat out of the yard <br><br>And like your body bein dragged behind the moon <br>You bring a memory of your mother like the money in your shoe <br>And how a penetrating wisdom, a bulletproof religion <br>Always rip you like a wool off of the loom <br><br>You floated farther than you ever meant to go <br>And only now see you are naked when the wind began to blow <br>There's no advice that you've been missing <br>No trespass unforgiven <br>Just a rebel with no pity for your boat <br><br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening <br>The dogs were loose and lyin on the street <br>You've learned to blend into the choir <br>How to hold your hand in fire <br>And what to say instead of what you mean <br>With a just how hard it can be <br><br>You met the women gluing jewels onto a crown <br>You know men hidin in the city and their way of being found <br>And you got nothin on your shoulders <br>Still there's nothin too much colder <br>Than a rubble of a house that's fallin down <br><br>Liek a baby cryin till it falls asleep <br>The autumn's over by the time you count the color of the leaves <br>You're paintin buzzards on the ceiling <br>Fallin faithless at the healin <br>With your friends around you wailin on their knees <br><br>And I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening <br>The fog it swallowed everything but us <br>You've learned to balance on the cable <br>Drink us all under the table <br>And who to try instead of who you trust <br>With a hand on your heart that threw you under the bus <br><br>So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want <br>The sun is shinin and you cleaned your pretty pistol of a heart <br>But when you talk about tomorrow <br>When to beg and when to borrow <br>Try to hit the ground before you hear the shot <br><br>And like a fish too deep and driftin in the sea <br>You've grown accustomed to the blindness lookin up and anxiously <br>But there's a stone inside your pocket while you're plowin through the market <br>But you know even the time it takes ain't free <br><br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening <br>The stars were barely hangin in the sky <br>You've learned to eat when you're not hungry <br>How to laugh when nothin's funny <br>And what to get instead of getting by <br>But oh, how it changes with the passing of time <br><br>You heard so many voices hidden in the wind <br>See all the children of the world and how its fingers reach for them <br>Two branches tired of their bending <br>I don't see our story ending <br>Quite as clean as it was easy to begin <br><br>Like a hole that let the fox under the fence <br>You've got no solace and no sanctuary you can recommend <br>Beggin for mercy at the bedside <br>We got frozen in the headlights <br>But our kind of mercy never made much sense <br><br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening <br>But both were disappearin in the waves <br>You've learned to lead the one you follow <br>How to spit out what you swallow <br>And when to hand instead of give away <br>That secret of ours is one I'll take to the grave <br><br>So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want <br>The sun is shinin and I think you want me more often than not <br>But like your father in the garden <br>I won't finish what I started <br>Till you bill me for the flowers I forgot <br><br>But like a curse too old for anyone to care <br>You said to meet you on the mountain cause you never make it there <br>In Sochi down along the highway <br>Proudly promisin that one day <br>I'd miss the way we tumbled down the stairs <br><br>And I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening <br>The car was gently glidin off the road <br>You've learned to rise above your body <br>How to never say you're sorry <br>And where to go instead of going home <br><br>light by the bed <br>And all the clothes you've outgrown </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Archive Series Volume No.3</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-06-28</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0031623727468371" data-ad-slot="4233283621" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>
