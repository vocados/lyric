your lovers always lose you in the dark</br>And they were all chosen to remember how the sparrows hit the window</br>That you closed to keep the cat out of the yard</br>And like your body bein dragged behind the moon</br>You bring a memory of your mother like the money in your shoe</br>And how a penetrating wisdom, a bulletproof religion</br>Always rip you like a wool off of the loom</br>You floated farther than you ever meant to go</br>And only now see you are naked when the wind began to blow</br>There's no advice that you've been missing</br>No trespass unforgiven</br>Just a rebel with no pity for your boat</br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening</br>The dogs were loose and lyin on the street</br>You've learned to blend into the choir</br>How to hold your hand in fire</br>And what to say instead of what you mean</br>With a just how hard it can be</br>You met the women gluing jewels onto a crown</br>You know men hidin in the city and their way of being found</br>And you got nothin on your shoulders</br>Still there's nothin too much colder</br>Than a rubble of a house that's fallin down</br>Liek a baby cryin till it falls asleep</br>The autumn's over by the time you count the color of the leaves</br>You're paintin buzzards on the ceiling</br>Fallin faithless at the healin</br>With your friends around you wailin on their knees</br>And I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening</br>The fog it swallowed everything but us</br>You've learned to balance on the cable</br>Drink us all under the table</br>And who to try instead of who you trust</br>With a hand on your heart that threw you under the bus</br>So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want</br>The sun is shinin and you cleaned your pretty pistol of a heart</br>But when you talk about tomorrow</br>When to beg and when to borrow</br>Try to hit the ground before you hear the shot</br>And like a fish too deep and driftin in the sea</br>You've grown accustomed to the blindness lookin up and anxiously</br>But there's a stone inside your pocket while you're plowin through the market</br>But you know even the time it takes ain't free</br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening</br>The stars were barely hangin in the sky</br>You've learned to eat when you're not hungry</br>How to laugh when nothin's funny</br>And what to get instead of getting by</br>But oh, how it changes with the passing of time</br>You heard so many voices hidden in the wind</br>See all the children of the world and how its fingers reach for them</br>Two branches tired of their bending</br>I don't see our story ending</br>Quite as clean as it was easy to begin</br>Like a hole that let the fox under the fence</br>You've got no solace and no sanctuary you can recommend</br>Beggin for mercy at the bedside</br>We got frozen in the headlights</br>But our kind of mercy never made much sense</br>I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening</br>But both were disappearin in the waves</br>You've learned to lead the one you follow</br>How to spit out what you swallow</br>And when to hand instead of give away</br>That secret of ours is one I'll take to the grave</br>So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want</br>The sun is shinin and I think you want me more often than not</br>But like your father in the garden</br>I won't finish what I started</br>Till you bill me for the flowers I forgot</br>But like a curse too old for anyone to care</br>You said to meet you on the mountain cause you never make it there</br>In Sochi down along the highway</br>Proudly promisin that one day</br>I'd miss the way we tumbled down the stairs</br>And I've come to know that I was stealin all your kisses on the evening</br>The car was gently glidin off the road</br>You've learned to rise above your body</br>How to never say you're sorry</br>And where to go instead of going home</br>light by the bed</br>And all the clothes you've outgrown<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Archive Series Volume No.3</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-06-28</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Folk</h3></p>
