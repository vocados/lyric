</script> <p>This is my story</br>This is my story</br>Came from radio, it was late</br>Left the car, went straight to my gate</br>Head straight</br>Didn't even look left</br>Got my key out, started hearing footsteps</br>Right over my shoulder</br>Had to act fast, I can hear them getting closer</br>Tryna' keep calm and put my key into the door</br>Thinking to myself if I don't make it then it's over</br>I don't know how I managed it</br>Ran into my mum's room panicking</br>Mum shouting at me Karl what's happening</br>Carl shouting at me Karl what's happening</br>How the hell did I get in this</br>Tryna' hold the door but it's coming off the hinges</br>Somebody wake me from this dream now</br>Then I hear a gunshot and my mum scream out</br>Somebody come and save the day</br>Somebody take this pain away</br>How can I ask God for help now, when I ain't even prayed today</br>Is this how my life ends Nowhere to run, no place to hide in</br>Carl ran out of the room tryna' fight them</br>Two more gun shots, everything's silent</br>Mum ran downstairs, she's crying</br>And I can't move a muscle but I'm trying</br>Praying for an ambulance but I can't hear a siren</br>She said he's shot I hope she's lying</br>I hear her shouting out for help, I think he's dying</br>I'm thinking why him Was it wrong place, wrong timing</br>I see him at the bottom of the stairs</br>Mum shaking while the neighbours tryna' save him, heart racing, wishing I could disappear</br>And it shoulda been me but it's him lying there</br>And I know it isn't fair</br>I phone Skanks, phone Shook, my whole body's in shock, I couldn't even shed a tear</br>Trapped in this nightmare, how did I get here</br>This is my story</br>All the pain, all the things, falling on me</br>All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry</br>Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me</br>This is my story</br>This is my story</br>Woke up to a ping on my blackberry</br>It was a message from Kone saying somebody tried to kill me and got my family</br>I rubbed my eyes, is this a dream or reality</br>Kone said Krept who the fuck was this mad at me</br>God, how we gon' solve this catastrophe</br>Then God gave us 'Otis' it was a blessing from him</br>Cos it stopped us from going getting reckless on him</br>Thinking to quit music</br>Thinking to go and do something stupid</br>Then things fell in place and started improving</br>That's why I say the music chose us, we didn't choose it</br>Bearing in mind Kone started from scratch</br>Feds took his house, money, clothes, he never had jack</br>Then I got a call from Vash</br>He told us the plan so we got up in the lab</br>Then things started to pick up even more</br>Skepta hollered at me, said that we should come on tour</br>Skepta don't even realise what he did for us</br>Well if you're listening, thank you for help fixing us</br>From the tour, all these shows start coming in</br>Back on our feet now the money started flooding in</br>Invested in clothes and money started doubling</br>Now so much for struggling</br>Watching Kones getting back up on his feet</br>Thinking how's he coping, I couldn't if it was me</br>Now Play Dirty's on the up fucking up the streets</br>Everyday a new city that we reach</br>But even though we turned around a mess</br>I'm sitting in my yard thinking that I could be next</br>Thinking did I give anyone his address</br>That shit that happened to Kone still playing in my head</br>Thinking 'bout he day it happened, when I saw his mum</br>And she told me please look after my son</br>Not a single tear on her face showing</br>Even though I know her heart's broken</br>Staying strong even though we're stressing</br>Cos she lost her husband and that being the second</br>That's why the music is a must to us</br>Kone he's going to make it up to her</br>This is my story</br>All the pain, all the things, falling on me</br>All the blood, sweat and tears but don't worry</br>Flashing lights, seen my life flash before me</br>This is my story</br>This is my story<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Young Kingz</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2013-09-02</h3><h3
