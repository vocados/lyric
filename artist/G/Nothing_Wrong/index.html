finish off a fifth, I don't see nothin' wrong</br>If I spend a few bands when I should have let it stack</br>I can make that shit back, I don't see nothin' wrong</br>If I smoke a whole ounce and I ain't even leave the house</br>I could look at my accounts and I don't see nothin' wrong</br>I'm unapologetic, you can tell by what I'm on</br>If you don't like me, fuck you, this is nothin' but a

appreciatin' the molly and my Fiji buzz</br>Why stress, I'm too blessed to ever come down</br>I might be the rarest cat that's ever been found</br>I'm on one off the medicine now and it's a Wednesday</br>I'll end up fuckin' something and wake up drunk the next day</br>They love to talk about it, people sayin' I'm reckless</br>The microscope I'm under, they just love to inspect us</br>But fuck 'em, make them eat their words for dinner and breakfast</br>That shit come back around, full circle though like a necklace</br>Fuck outta here, I came for no bullshit in my agenda</br>If you're artificial Splenda, well then you are not a friend</br>I never save, I'm spending cash for as long as I remember</br>So I went to spend a fortune on this Porsche and not a rental</br>[Hook]</br>If she

crazy, and I maybe am</br>Killing hella brain cells in my cranium</br>The realest who did it and got away with it</br>They pouring drugs on titties and now and everybody sniffin'</br>She acting shocked by it, guess we live a little different</br>I'm out here just mobbin' in my Oakland A's fitted</br>I'd never sell my soul, I stay green and gold</br>I knew I'd be a legend back since I was 10 years old</br>I knew I would be cold, his story would be told</br>I'ma have to fuck Jessica soon, before she gets too old (Alba)</br>I'll snatch her from her husband, I told you I was cold</br>I'm going Super Saiyan, yes I'm enterin' that mode</br>Like Goku, I'm boastful, I'm so anti-social</br>The money's all I say hello to, like goddamn, that's so true</br>[Hook]</br>If she just wanna sniff,
