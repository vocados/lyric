</script> <p>I find it funny how niggas start talking money</br>I'm living lovely, apartment far from the bunjee</br>I remember us living not too far from the junkees</br>The flunkees that tried to to punk me on corners but never sung me I swear</br>In this bitch, yeah I'm killing this year</br>Them boys hated, they gon' feel it this year</br>I bought a 'rari, I only drove in it once</br>I'm movin different this year</br>I'm leaving thousands, talking millions this year</br>When niggas really talkin'</br>Talkin' over, talk it over</br>Renegotiate and make the play and they cough it over</br>I crossed over like Iverson when he dropped the shoulder on Jordan</br>The feelin' more than the sport when you winning fuck how they feelin'</br>The feelings got left aside</br>I told them to step aside</br>I'm rarely eating, I'm ordering more extra size, you know me</br>Round the block, glovers spittin' them hot flows</br>My sense smells like Michelle was touching Barack's clothes</br>Presidential, the flow is so evidential</br>At the clearport customs, I barely show my credentials</br>Don't need a tinted, I want you to know who's in it</br>Had me offended last time that I walked in the Holt Renfrew</br>Let's break it down for 'em</br>Account this, if every show is a 100 thou' for him</br>Then that mean, a hundred minutes on stage will equal a 100k</br>That's one thousand a minute</br>So please don't get offended, if I walk inside a store and spend 35k in it</br>'Cause to me, that's just 35 minutes</br>Land in Jamaica, sip on a Guinness and get it</br>Who wanna witness my nigga, I'm really sick with the shits</br>I brought big Poppy out at the SumFest</br>Sean Kingston watched it from the side stage</br>I made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year, 45 minutes of me on stage</br>And I'm not amazed</br>I think the tables turning</br>I think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burning</br>I think you learn from the world when you see it turning</br>I went from being a server to being this platinum deserver, you feel me?</br>Did a song with Meek Milly, called it "Litty"</br>Really I just did that shit for the city in love with Philly</br>God, this chinchilla fur on me, just in case it gets chilly</br>Burner on my side pocket, just that's incase you get illy out here</br>Me and Travi$ Scott almost fought at the Mala Luna</br>We both agreed shortly after that it was music</br>That we could be possibly doing that bigger than tryna ruin it</br>So my apologies, nigga, just forgive me for doing it</br>History made in New York City, we called a truce at the tower</br>I only brought a couple niggas with me</br>The beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watching</br>The attention in the industry started shifting to me</br>Lord forgive 'em, Lord forgive 'em, I was tripping all the time</br>I spit subliminal dissing just tryna rip shit</br>Not realising if I took the time to kick it, and me and Drake, man, them bridges would probably equal to winning</br>Got the hard head flow, money coming in so thick</br>Them nigga call it hard bread dough</br>I'm in this all red four seater, I'm leaning like the '06 fours</br>I said I'd stop freestyling but fuck it, oh well</br>A nigga flow so well, I'm like a sampling kit</br>Give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits</br>Niggas mad I'm remixing their shit</br>Fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch</br>I think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talking violent</br>Speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'</br>R&B niggas with Sisqo haircuts, wildin' and stylin'</br>They dissing, guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em</br>This your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song</br>Except when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song</br>You a weird diss in a flex R8</br>I could've flexed a 'rari or Wraith, but nigga, I ain't</br>Instead, I bought my house the other day and flexed in the paint</br>Real estate, I'm property shopping, bitches probably watching</br>Got the Gadget-Go flow, Nobu and So-Ho</br>I've been crossed by some nigga I used to go toe-to-toe for</br>Blow for blow flow, sick enough to eat a blowfish</br>G5 jet plane, goldfish eating more fish</br>Just for the record, I did this shit for the hopeless</br>Just drove a Rolls
