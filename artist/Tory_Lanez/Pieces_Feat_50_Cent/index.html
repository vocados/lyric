Cent)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Tory Lanez<br><br> Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit <br>Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit <br>Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip <br>Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit <br><br>[Verse 1: Tory Lanez] <br>And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason <br>She got herself inside of this situation in the first place <br>Brooklyn murder lathers a birth place <br>Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on a worst days <br>I used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger <br>Livin' from where she was at was a plain picture <br>I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together <br>Instead of listen, she just kinda blew me off <br>Paid it no mind, but it kind of just threw me off <br>I guess I figured out, everybody wants riches and the cars <br>But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced <br>Early, her papa, he was taken by the force <br>Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her <br>Then she gave her to her uncle, her brother played the saviour <br>Until the day he started datin' this chick <br>That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills <br>She told me that one night he had got so fucked up <br>He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona <br>And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing <br>And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move <br>Before she could even finish, she rolled out in tears and did it <br>Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feelin', a fear <br>That she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there <br>Started talkin' lower and she told me come here <br>She said she had to make choices <br>So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel <br>Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel <br>Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill <br>And said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason <br>She got herself inside of this situation in the first place <br>Figured this intimidation was the worst case <br>She sat back and blew six in that boy face <br><br>[Interlude] <br>*gun shots* <br>Shot, him, dead <br><br>[Chorus: Tory Lanez] <br>I want you, my dear <br>No, I won't leave you lonely <br>You hold your head up high <br>I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely <br><br>[Verse 2: Tory Lanez] <br>He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason <br>He got himself inside of this situation in the first place <br>He had no father figure <br>He told me that his papa got shot in the face <br>And he can't wait to find out who his killer <br>He dedicated his life and now wants to know who had a motive to kill his only father <br>He felt, it had to be somebody close <br>It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im <br>But take this pardon <br>When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin <br>The woman that used to show him the ropes <br>She used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch her <br>And if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka <br>One day, he was on the block rollin' <br>Then, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him <br>That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen <br>He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum <br>A scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, from when you fell off in the road" <br>At that point, he looked at her face and he froze <br>She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him <br>She says to him, "I was gon' wait until you got older <br>But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you <br>The whole block know me and the whole block know you <br>The whole block been knew this story, but they ain't told you" <br>His mom says to him, "I hope you know your pap was a good man <br>But he just had some nonsense to him <br>Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills <br>I'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm sayin' fails <br>You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn, where we would leave ya, uh <br>I know she love you, but the story's more deeper <br>Uh, you see, your father used to be a creeper <br>He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her <br>Used to leave her so confused she would lace her coke and reefer <br>Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper <br>You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure out who's the nigga <br>Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga <br>When your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga <br>She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga" <br>His anger was dwellin' all on his mind <br>He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his 9 <br>And uh, before he knew, he aimed it up at his mom <br>And uh, *gun shots* he shot her right in his spine <br>He said, "This is why, my life has been full of lies <br>Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'? <br>This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind <br>I know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive" <br><br>[Bridge: 50 Cent] <br>Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit <br>Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit <br>Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip <br>Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit <br><br>[Verse 3: 50 Cent] <br>Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped-ons <br>Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on <br>Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy <br>A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby <br>How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? <br>Love turn to hate? Fuck shit or fake <br>Your next move may raise the murder rate <br>From average to savage, to semi-automatics <br>It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it <br><br>[Chorus: Tory Lanez] <br>I want you, my dear <br>No, I won't leave you lonely <br>You hold your head up high <br>I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely <br>Can't leave you lonely </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>MEMORIES DON'T DIE</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2018-03-02</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Rap / Hip-hop</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
