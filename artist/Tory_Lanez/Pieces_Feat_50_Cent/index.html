off, somehow we end up in the same shit</br>[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]</br>And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason</br>She got herself inside of this situation in the first place</br>Brooklyn murder lathers a birth place</br>Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on a worst days</br>I used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger</br>Livin' from where she was at was a plain picture</br>I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together</br>Instead of listen, she just kinda blew me off</br>Paid it no mind, but it kind of just threw me off</br>I guess I figured out, everybody wants riches and the cars</br>But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced</br>Early, her papa, he was taken by the force</br>Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her</br>Then she gave her to her uncle, her brother played the saviour</br>Until the day he started datin' this chick</br>That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills</br>She told me that one night he had got so fucked up</br>He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona</br>And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing</br>And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move</br>Before she could even finish, she rolled out in tears and did it</br>Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feelin', a fear</br>That she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there</br>Started talkin' lower and she told me come here</br>She said she had to make choices</br>So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel</br>Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel</br>Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill</br>And said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason</br>She got herself inside of this situation in the first place</br>Figured this intimidation was the worst case</br>She sat back and blew six in that boy face</br>[Interlude]</br>*gun shots*</br>Shot, him, dead</br>[Chorus: Tory Lanez]</br>I want you, my dear</br>No, I won't leave you lonely</br>You hold your head up high</br>I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely</br>[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]</br>He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason</br>He got himself inside of this situation in the first place</br>He had no father figure</br>He told me that his papa got shot in the face</br>And he can't wait to find out who his killer</br>He dedicated his life and now wants to know who had a motive to kill his only father</br>He felt, it had to be somebody close</br>It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im</br>But take this pardon</br>When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin</br>The woman that used to show him the ropes</br>She used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch her</br>And if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka</br>One day, he was on the block rollin'</br>Then, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him</br>That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen</br>He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum</br>A scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, from when you fell off in the road"</br>At that point, he looked at her face and he froze</br>She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him</br>She says to him, "I was gon' wait until you got older</br>But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you</br>The whole block know me and the whole block know you</br>The whole block been knew this story, but they ain't told you"</br>His mom says to him, "I hope you know your pap was a good man</br>But he just had some nonsense to him</br>Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills</br>I'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm sayin' fails</br>You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn, where we would leave ya, uh</br>I know she love you, but the story's more deeper</br>Uh, you see, your father used to be a creeper</br>He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her</br>Used to leave her so confused she would lace her coke and reefer</br>Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper</br>You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure out who's the nigga</br>Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga</br>When your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga</br>She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga"</br>His anger was dwellin' all on his mind</br>He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his 9</br>And uh, before he knew, he aimed it up at his mom</br>And uh, *gun shots* he shot her right in his spine</br>He said, "This is why, my life has been full of lies</br>Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?</br>This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind</br>I know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive"</br>[Bridge: 50 Cent]</br>Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit</br>Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit</br>Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip</br>Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit</br>[Verse 3: 50 Cent]</br>Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped-ons</br>Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on</br>Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy</br>A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby</br>How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break?</br>Love turn to hate? Fuck shit or fake</br>Your next move may raise the murder rate</br>From average to savage, to semi-automatics</br>It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it</br>[Chorus: Tory Lanez]</br>I want you, my dear</br>No, I won't leave you lonely</br>You hold your head up high</br>I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely</br>Can't leave you lonely<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : MEMORIES DON'T DIE</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2018-03-02</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap / Hip-hop</h3></p> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center mb-2"> <div id=map style=width:90%;height:350px;></div> </div> <div class=row id=alert></div> <div style=width:100%;text-align:center;> <div class=addthis_inline_share_toolbox></div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class="text-muted py-5"> <div class=container> <p style="text-align: center;"> © 2018 <a href=https://lyric.vicharas.net>lyric</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=/static/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script> <script async src=/static/post.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6348c0333cdd32b3"></script></body></html>
