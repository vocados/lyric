pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha</br>I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture</br>Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister</br>I see myself in the young ones</br>When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror</br>Corleone all on my own Don</br>Cartier all on my arm</br>All I hear is sirens and car alarms</br>Niggas going to war with no armor on</br>First time I seen a dead body I was 14</br>And I felt the pressure</br>Like if I don't get it, might end up next to him</br>I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7</br>Seven, seven, seven, 7 11 it's 911 getting called around</br>The hood America's lost and found</br>Where niggas get lost and never found</br>All I ever wanted was to turn

know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why</br>I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything</br>he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life</br>and just regretted it all and somehow</br>this is my chance to go back and get it all right</br>And when I wake up with that, I might say</br>you know it completely changes my hunger</br>how I approach the whole day</br>I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man</br>I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential</br>It's that simple It's all about living in the moment Period<h2
