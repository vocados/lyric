shadow</br>Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live</br>In the shadows people see you as happy and free</br>Because that's what you want them to see</br>Living two lives, happy, but not free</br>You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love</br>The world is changing and they say it's time to be free</br>But you live with the fear of just being me</br>Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be</br>No harm for them, no harm for me</br>But life is short, and it's time to be free</br>Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed</br>Smile<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : 4:44</h2><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>발매일 : 2017-07-10</h3><h3 style='font-size:1.3rem'>장르 : Rap / Hip-hop</h3></p> </div> <div class="row
