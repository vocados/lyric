shoot these pranksters</br>All of these rap singers claimin' they bangers</br>Doing all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers</br>Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners</br>I was doing this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers</br>I was moving them grams</br>Before you knew what a hand-to-hand was</br>Ducking the vans, radars, the scanners</br>Before you knew what hard white or tan was</br>I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bama's</br>I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers</br>I was pricking my finger before you knew what a Fam was</br>I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was</br>300 mil later, now you understand us</br>Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas</br>You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night</br>Grand fucked up one fight, I was on the Peter Pan bus</br>You was putting Peter Pan up in your room</br>Y'all fucking with whom Allow me to retort</br>You cowards is just now learning the shit that we taught</br>You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report</br>About a high speed Porsche, ie</br>You niggas ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door</br>Like Eric B for Pres, respect me in this bitch</br>You can't disrespect us, 'cause you got a little check cut</br>You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your little neck up</br>Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches</br>You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous</br>I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game</br>It's only right I got the right to be king</br>Niggas that got life really like what I sing</br>'Cause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain</br>Know the shit I don't write be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game</br>Word to the hyphen in my name J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa</br>The past, present, nigga the future, proper</br>The holy trinity of hip-hop is us</br>We give Dre his props but that's where it stops, it's the Roc</br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me</br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me</br>You try, but what you think you saw</br>Ain't what you thought you saw</br>You better off not looking at all</br>Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before</br>People I used to know just don't know me no more</br>But everywhere that I go, I got people I know</br>Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low</br>I'm still on top of the game</br>Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim</br>Still at the top, had to rock for the fame</br>Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came</br>You seen it all, how I got, how I gained</br>The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain</br>When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim</br>The streets, they made a special spot for my name</br>Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign</br>But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins</br>The pride and the pain</br>All the way back from the rise of my name</br>See the world clear through the eyes of the mane</br>See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave</br>When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane</br>The eyes that I played</br>The best to emerge in the game is the Watcher</br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me</br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me</br>You try, but what you think you saw</br>Ain't what you thought you saw</br>You better off not looking at all</br>Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before</br>People I used to know just don't know me no more</br>But everywhere that I go, I got people I know</br>Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low</br>I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs</br>It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends</br>It's like, watching a movie through a panoramic screen</br>Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene</br>Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket</br>Some take the crack and chop it</br>But those that haven't got it take away the added profit</br>It's catastrophic I take the gat and cock it</br>And I'll sit back and watch it</br>These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully</br>The world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me</br>Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny</br>In the place where the number one cause of death is money</br>You can try copin'</br>I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken</br>I'm still alive and scopin'</br>Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in</br>And I'ma die with my eyes open, the Watcher</br>I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me</br>But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me</br>You try, but what you think you saw</br>Ain't what you thought you saw</br>You better off not looking at all</br>Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before</br>People I used to know just
