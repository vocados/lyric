</script> <p>Woo</br>Uhh, uhh</br>It's The Gift and the Curse</br>Uhh, uhh, yeah</br>First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again</br>They love me again</br>Let's take a trip down</br>I gotcha</br>Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery</br>Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every</br>Young black life is this line, Damn, him already</br>Such a good kid, got us pourin' Henn' already</br>Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above</br>When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love</br>So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi</br>Till the next time I see her, on the other side</br>He was just some thug that caught some slugs</br>And we loved him cause, in him we saw some of us</br>He walked like us, talked like us</br>His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn</br>Poor Isis, that's his mama name</br>Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name</br>Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him</br>Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband</br>Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him</br>Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him</br>Damn near impossible, only men can raise men</br>He was his own man, not even him can save him</br>He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist</br>But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate</br>End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm</br>That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world</br>Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away</br>Isis' life just ended on that rainy day</br>When she got the news her boy body could be viewed</br>Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude</br>Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew</br>Angel dust, dipped in WOO</br>She slipped into her own fantasy world</br>Had herself pregnant by a different dude</br>But reality bites and this is her life</br>He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife</br>It was just this night when moon was full</br>And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight</br>Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home</br>Will you still love me after this night</br>Mike was the hardhead from around the way</br>That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype</br>Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike</br>He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like</br>It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right</br>He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life</br>But Isis liked this Broadway life</br>She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites</br>Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight</br>She was so turned on that she had to shower twice</br>How ironic it would be some fight that</br>Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life</br>See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene</br>Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice</br>Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like</br>If that was my son, he would look much different</br>See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark</br>So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe</br>Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets fuck niggas want</br>Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach</br>It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak</br>He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day</br>He approached this thug that had a mean mug</br>And it looked so familiar that he called him Young Cuz</br>Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge fuck you</br>Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub</br>He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused hold up</br>There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before</br>It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature</br>And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord</br>You know what they say about he who hesitates in war</br>What's that He who hesitates is lost</br>He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank</br>The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct</br>Six shots into his kin, out of the gun</br>Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son</br>Six shots into his kin out of the gun</br>Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons</br>Meet the parents<h2 style='font-size:1.3rem'>앨범명 : Blueprint
