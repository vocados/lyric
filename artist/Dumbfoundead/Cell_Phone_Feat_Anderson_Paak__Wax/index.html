<br>Got one shoe on <br>and not the slightest clue <br>where my cell phone is <br>What was the name <br>I was definitely on one <br>Ronda Miranda or Sandra <br>Shouldn't have mixed that <br>light with the dark rum <br>Now I'm in the bathroom <br>throwin’ up a lung <br>Gotta make a run for dat <br>Gatorade punch <br>Head pounding on the one <br>like an 808 drum <br>Gotta grab Pho hangover 101 <br>It soaks it all up <br>you should know dat bruh <br>Pocket full of numbers covered <br>in weed crumbs <br>I'm a lover not a fighter <br>why my knuckles feel numb <br>No pun intended but I really <br>feel dumb founded <br>On my neighbors front <br>lawn throwin’ up <br>Seems last night <br>I was actin’ like a fool <br>Tagged Facebook pictures of <br>me jumpin’ in a pool <br>Wearing nothing but a hat <br>and my birthday suit <br>I was smashed to the max <br>on a work day too <br>But I looked overjoyed <br>in my polaroid pics <br>With my mustache fresh looking <br>like a koi fish <br>My swag turned up on dat <br>Soulja Boy shit <br>Feeling real good about <br>my bad choices <br>Who in the world is the girl <br>in my bed <br>Who's the dude on the couch <br>with dreads <br>And why in the hell was <br>I drinkin’ so much <br>Shoulda stuck with the weed <br>like Breezy told us <br>Now I'm lookin’ for the Folgers <br>awake from a coma <br>Making my way through empty <br>bottles of Corona <br>Follow the aroma <br>it leads to the doja <br>Roll up smoke up <br>and do it all over <br>Woke up so dizzy <br>Drunk and hungover <br>Can't find my house keys <br>Who was the chauffeur <br>Got one shoe on <br>and not the slightest clue <br>where my cell phone is <br>come on come on come on <br>come on come on <br>Friday night just got paid <br>Brand new fit clean boy shave <br>Feeling good pregame my place <br>The homies came through <br>with a gang of fade <br>They said they're trying to <br>get loose in a major way <br>So they sip grey goose <br>no juice just straight <br>What it do young buck pour a cup <br>I'm straight <br>I'm waiting on the tree <br>I got fifty on the Z <br>Plus I ain't even ate <br>Ya'll go heavy in the paint <br>I'll go heavy on the dank <br>You go heavy on the drink <br>and gon' end up on your face <br>Not me not me <br>But I don't think I'mma get my weed <br>No time soon I'mma have to proceed <br>To consume the first thing I see <br>A little OJ and another Belvadee <br>Two shots for her <br>two shots for me <br>The more that we booze <br>the less that we see <br>Now that is more booze than <br>Apollo Theatre up <br>like I'm big on the tree later <br>Outside pissing on the street haters <br>Cops came through on the creep <br>gave me <br>A ticket and a mufuckin' speech <br>And meanwhile on repeat <br>Shots shots shots shots <br>I'm thinking stop <br>it's not that deep damn <br>Trying to give it all I got got <br>And then I threw up <br>in the god damn sink <br>that's weak <br>Woke up so dizzy <br>Drunk and hungover <br>Can't find my house keys <br>Who was the chauffeur <br>Got one shoe on <br>and not the slightest clue <br>where my cell phone is <br>There's an unfamiliar ceiling <br>in this place <br>With a very familiar feeling <br>of disgrace <br>As my eyes open up for <br>the first time after <br>Another blackout catastrophe <br>disaster <br>And captures the image of <br>the rafters above <br>And the cold concrete <br>on my back is enough <br>To wake me and make me <br>stand up in amazement <br>Where is this unfinished basement <br>How'd I get here <br>I need to get home <br>But I can't leave until I find <br>my key and my phone <br>Then I see a girl asleep and <br>alone in the corner <br>I walk toward her not knowing <br>for sure who she was <br>I just hoped that her phone was on <br>And I ain't spoken to my girl <br>I told her I would call her <br>Tapped on her cold shoulder <br>when she rolled over <br>I saw her damn <br>My memory is better than I think <br>I remember last night <br>had her bent over the sink <br>In the bathroom <br>staring at her lower back tattoo <br>Flashback boom and <br>I'm back to the new <br>Back to the what now <br>what am I gonna do <br>Picked up her phone and dialed <br>my own number to <br>See if I could hear it ringing <br>and sure enough <br>It's on the floor of the bathroom <br>with more of my stuff <br>Condom keys and my wallet <br>An absent-minded strategic alcoholic <br>Strategic cause the condom <br>wrapper was empty <br>Tip-toed out the door kinda gently <br>Woke up so dizzy <br>Drunk and hungover <br>Can't find my house keys <br>Who was the chauffeur <br>Got one shoe on <br>and not the slightest clue <br>where my cell phone is <br></p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>DFD</td></tr><tr><th
