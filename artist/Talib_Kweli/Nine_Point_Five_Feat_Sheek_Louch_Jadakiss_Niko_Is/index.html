Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Niko Is)</h1><br/><p class="lead"> Artist - Talib Kweli<br><br> As time goes by, an eye for an eye <br>That's the best way to keep everybody blind <br>When the truth is in the building all these lives gon' die <br>Cause like my man Chaz Van, eh the vibes don't lie <br>Man, get your hands up in the sky, wave 'em from side to side <br>Cause I'm twenty years plus, still killin' it right <br>This Marco Polo off the Richter, man it's 95 <br>You make the earth quake, shakin' to death like fault line <br>Now when I talk about vibe, what I mean is organic <br>We planting seeds for the trees, we need to breathe on the planet <br>Indeed we really take the planet for granted <br>Bulldoze the granite at Standing Rock <br>We plundered and we wonder why the planet hot <br>Made in His image, are we worshipping the man or not <br>Get an uncomfortable feeling every time I hear Planet Rock <br>Disappointed in the leadership, hand to God <br>Evidence is more than the images the cameras shot <br>You follow blind faith it make you seem unclean <br>But faith in only evidence of things I've seen <br>Cause information make it harder for us to follow discussions <br>But educated guesses beat wild assumptions <br>Information lead to knowledge, knowledge lead to wisdom <br>Wisdom lead to understanding, once you have all that <br>You start demanding justice <br>Justice is what love look like in public <br>I ain't just writing for it, I'm out here fighting for it <br><br>We some real muthafuckas on the rise <br>Under pressure but over the lies <br>Stand up, hands up close to the skies <br>'Bout to shake the world up on a nine point five <br>We some real muthafuckas on the rise <br>Under pressure but over the lies <br>Stand up, hands up close to the skies <br>'Bout to shake the world up on a nine point five <br><br>Contemplating, I be hating how we coming up short <br>Filling up court, my skin pigment new black thought <br>Telling me lies, ain't nothing about you moving no pies <br>Fabricating on your Instagram, listen fam you a king <br>But you carry yourself way too weak <br>Songs I sing is prophesized, modern day Haile Selassie <br>Coke bars singing young papi <br>Now, who want this four pound of knowledge I shoot <br>Still wavy Rolex on, bitch calling me cute <br>Hands up for some real niggas, when I rise, you rise <br>Right now I ain't got no more tries <br>Mom's chillin' watching over me, no more cries <br><br>No more tears, right now no more years <br>And we could throw a million protests, no one cares <br>'Cause we just get all out of character and throw some chairs <br>Eventually they burn us out and tell us go somewhere <br>But the love is too genuine and wholesome here <br>That's why the light ain't too bright but the road look clear <br>Yea, personally I got my bread as a crook <br>But once I finish with the work I dip my head in a book <br>There's room in the bed, either at the head or the foot <br>I tell you this, Hip Hop ain't as dead as it looks <br>Naw, diversions to cover up the lies <br>We some real muthafuckas on the rise <br><br>We some real muthafuckas on the rise <br>Under pressure but over the lies <br>Stand up, hands up close to the skies <br>'Bout to shake the world up on a nine point five <br>We some real muthafuckas on the rise <br>Under pressure but over the lies <br>Stand up, hands up close to the skies <br>'Bout to shake the world up on a nine point five <br><br>As time goes by, an eye for an eye <br>You won't hear a tear drop when a young child cries <br>Made in God's image but tell me do God lie <br>You're deceiving, is it racism in the sky <br>I believe in God, but <br>Yea I got my third eye, wish I had my third ear <br>Seventh sense, I got my sixth sense in third gear <br>On a highway to hell, learn how to swerve fear <br>It's deep talk or street talk <br>It's war talk or it's peace talk <br>Get the hemp paper, tear the leaf off <br>Spoke like you woke but you actin' all sleep dog <br>The wolves give a fuck about sheep talk <br>The rich give a fuck about cheap talk <br>How figuring angles, ways to knock the beast off <br>This is Satan's house but we plannin' to break the lease off <br>Me and Kweli on the rise <br>Ghost, but you see some Ali in his eyes <br>Pressure bust pipes but it still make diamonds <br>Shining, see the silver lining in the sky <br>I don't ride waves cause I'm my own tide <br>Learn to be peaceful, dealt my own pride <br>Ego, the feeble will always make the stride to take the strong out <br>Know hard work, took the long route <br>And I could do it two more times <br>Or matter of fact, a few more times <br>Tell your favorite emcee to make a few more rhymes <br>Then meet us on the Seven tour <br>What he feelin' threatened for <br>We gon' kill 'em lyrically, what he bring his weapons for <br>Hands up, stand up, what you think we reppin' for <br>We some real muthafuckas, don't you know that <br>Lyrically, you gon' get this picture like a Kodak </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>The Seven</td></tr><tr><th
