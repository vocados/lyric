</script> <p>It's only when the high winds blow that I wish my hair was long</br>Sailing through the autumn leaves singing an ancient song</br>Or falling in love in the streets at night at the edge of a local square</br>It's only that I'm here tonight thinking I was there</br>There are high winds on the pier tonight, my soul departs from me</br>Striding like Thalia's ghost south on the murky sea</br>And into midnight's tapestry she fades, ragged and wild</br>Searching down her ancestry in the costume of a Persian child</br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon</br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew</br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low</br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico</br>When I was young my eyes were wise, my father was good to me</br>Instead of having a flock of sons he had two other girls and me</br>And if we had used our Spanish names, here's the way they'd run</br>Thalia, Margarita and Juanita, I'm the middle one</br>The screen door kept the demons in as we moved from town to town</br>It's hard to be a princess in the States when your skin is brown</br>And mama smoothed my worried brow as I leaned on the kitchen door</br>Why do you carry the weight, she said, of the world and maybe more</br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon</br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew</br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low</br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico</br>My grandfathers were ministers and it came on down the line</br>My father preached in his parents' church when he was ten years and nine</br>And mama dressed in parishoners' clothes and didn't believe in hell</br>Her daddy fought the DAR, if he'd lived I'd have known him well</br>They said go find a Sunday School, we must have tried them all</br>I never stole from the silver plate, my sisters had more gall</br>One preacher said sing out loud and clear, it's the only life you've got</br>And the next one said be good on earth, you've another life at the feet of God</br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon</br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew</br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low</br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico</br>My father turned down many a job just to give us something real</br>It's hard to be a scientist in the States when you've got ideals</br>And mama kept the budget book, she kept the garden, too</br>Bought fish from the man on Thursday, fed all of us and strangers, too</br>But time will pass and so, alas, will most of what we know</br>Though tonight my memory's eye is clear as the story's being told</br>And I'll play ball with the underdog and sit with the child who's wrong</br>Be still when the earth is silent and sing when my strength is gone</br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon</br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew</br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low</br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico</br>Now father's going to India sometime in the fall</br>They tried to stay together but you just can't do it all</br>I'll think about him if he goes, there's a little grey in his hair</br>Though not much because he's Mexican, they don't age, they just prepare</br>And if he goes to India I'll miss him most of all</br>He'll see me in the mudlarks' face, hear me in the beggar's call</br>And mama will stay home, I guess, and worry if she did wrong</br>And I'll say a prayer for both of them and sing them both my song</br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon</br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew</br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low</br>Echo the songs
