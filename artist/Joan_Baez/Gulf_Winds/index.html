Joan Baez<br><br> It's only when the high winds blow that I wish my hair was long <br>Sailing through the autumn leaves singing an ancient song <br>Or falling in love in the streets at night at the edge of a local square <br>It's only that I'm here tonight thinking I was there <br><br>There are high winds on the pier tonight, my soul departs from me <br>Striding like Thalia's ghost south on the murky sea <br>And into midnight's tapestry she fades, ragged and wild <br>Searching down her ancestry in the costume of a Persian child <br><br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon <br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew <br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low <br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico <br><br>When I was young my eyes were wise, my father was good to me <br>Instead of having a flock of sons he had two other girls and me <br>And if we had used our Spanish names, here's the way they'd run <br>Thalia, Margarita and Juanita, I'm the middle one <br><br>The screen door kept the demons in as we moved from town to town <br>It's hard to be a princess in the States when your skin is brown <br>And mama smoothed my worried brow as I leaned on the kitchen door <br>Why do you carry the weight, she said, of the world and maybe more <br><br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon <br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew <br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low <br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico <br><br>My grandfathers were ministers and it came on down the line <br>My father preached in his parents' church when he was ten years and nine <br>And mama dressed in parishoners' clothes and didn't believe in hell <br>Her daddy fought the DAR, if he'd lived I'd have known him well <br><br>They said go find a Sunday School, we must have tried them all <br>I never stole from the silver plate, my sisters had more gall <br>One preacher said sing out loud and clear, it's the only life you've got <br>And the next one said be good on earth, you've another life at the feet of God <br><br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon <br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew <br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low <br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico <br><br>My father turned down many a job just to give us something real <br>It's hard to be a scientist in the States when you've got ideals <br>And mama kept the budget book, she kept the garden, too <br>Bought fish from the man on Thursday, fed all of us and strangers, too <br><br>But time will pass and so, alas, will most of what we know <br>Though tonight my memory's eye is clear as the story's being told <br>And I'll play ball with the underdog and sit with the child who's wrong <br>Be still when the earth is silent and sing when my strength is gone <br><br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon <br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew <br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low <br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico <br><br>Now father's going to India sometime in the fall <br>They tried to stay together but you just can't do it all <br>I'll think about him if he goes, there's a little grey in his hair <br>Though not much because he's Mexican, they don't age, they just prepare <br><br>And if he goes to India I'll miss him most of all <br>He'll see me in the mudlarks' face, hear me in the beggar's call <br>And mama will stay home, I guess, and worry if she did wrong <br>And I'll say a prayer for both of them and sing them both my song <br><br>And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon <br>Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew <br>And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low <br>Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Gulf Winds</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-04-07</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
