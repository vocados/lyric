Joan Baez<br><br> Oh, where have you been, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, where have you been, my darling young one <br>I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains <br>I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways <br><br>I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests <br>I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans <br>I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, and it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, what did you see, my darling young one <br>I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it <br>I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it <br><br>I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' <br>I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin' <br>I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken <br>I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>And what did you hear, my blue eyed son <br>And what did you hear, my darling young one <br>I heard the sound of a thunder, is it roared out a warnin' <br>Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world <br><br>I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin' <br>I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin' <br>I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' <br>I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter <br>I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>And who did you meet, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, who did you meet, my darling young one <br>I met a young child beside a dead pony <br>I met a white man who walked a black dog <br><br>I met a young woman whose body was burning <br>I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow <br>I met one man who was wounded in love <br>I met another man who was wounded with hatred <br><br>And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>Oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one <br>Well, I'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin' <br>Well, I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest <br><br>Where the people are many and their hands are all empty <br>Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters <br>Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison <br>Where the executioner's face is always well hidden <br><br>Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten <br>Where black is the color, and none is the number <br>And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it <br>And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it <br><br>And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' <br>But I'll know my song well before I start singin' <br><br>And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Live In `75 (Live)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2016-10-28</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Country</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
