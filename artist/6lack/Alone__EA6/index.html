flaw, she flaw, what's wrong</br>I got troubles, and they won't leave me alone</br>It seems like everybody got something to say</br>Everybody got a look they tryna get off of their face</br>Everybody got an opinion</br>And I don't want one</br>Trying to tell me a better way to do some shit</br>That you ain't ever done</br>Sips drink in the booth</br>Black down to my shoes</br>Kick shit with my troops</br>Kicking shit, Ryu</br>You not with the shit why you</br>Front for those who don't matter</br>When they not thinking about you</br>If I learned anything</br>It would probably be to listen more than I talk</br>And don't brag about what I got</br>Just multiply what I brought</br>I never dwell on a loss</br>Never give a nigga sauce</br>He might run off with it all</br>Get gone get gone

flaw, she flaw, what's wrong</br>I got troubles, and they won't leave me alone</br>On the record, off the record</br>Feel like I'm more of myself than I've ever been</br>Which is something you gotta come to face with</br>I thought I was fully myself 24 7</br>But nope, like right now is how I'm supposed to feel all the time</br>How I'm supposed to be all the time</br>How I'm supposed to think all the time</br>Now I know going out of this, leaving this</br>That will follow me It doesn't end with this</br>I take it, I live with it every day</br>I see the people around me</br>I feel so much</br>I wanna put it in words</br>Try and figure where to go with it</br>But I just feel so much</br>I know they don't even feel as much as I feel</br>That's alright</br>That's alright</br>We have 2 different purposes</br>Clearly my purpose is some shit that's way fucking bigger than me</br>Then it gets completely quiet when im at the beach</br>I know I'm one person but I kinda feel like this ripple effect is gonna impact a lot of people</br>I feel God talking and when he talks everything else is silent</br>Summer 2011</br>Almost lost my faith in god</br>Same time I never prayed so hard</br>Took control of my life so I wouldn't have to take no job</br>Press play I couldn't take no pause</br>I'm from east Atlanta 6 they don't play that shit</br>In east Atlanta six you better make that lick</br>Or they
