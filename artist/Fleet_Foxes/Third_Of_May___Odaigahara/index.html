Did you change overnight? <br>Second son, on the other line <br><br>Now, back in our town as a castaway <br>I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May <br>As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away <br>Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center <br>Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves? <br><br>Was I too slow? Did I change overnight? <br>Second son, for the second time <br><br>Can I be light and free? <br>If I lead you through the fury will you call to me? <br>And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory? <br><br>But all will fade. All I say. All I needed <br>As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded <br><br>Life unfolds in pools of gold <br>I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold <br>To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know <br><br>But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it <br>And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it <br><br>I was a fool <br>Crime after crime to confess to <br>But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you <br>Hold fast to the wing. Hold fast to the wing </p><table class="table table-striped table-dark"><tbody><tr><th scope="row">앨범</th><td>Crack-Up</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">발매일</th><td>2017-06-16</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">장르</th><td>Folk</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div class="list-group" id="listGroup"></div><br><br><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
