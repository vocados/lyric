<br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>I remember back in the days <br>When I just a little niggarole <br>I looked up to my bigger bro <br>Begged if I could kick it so <br>When he went out with girls I could go tagging along <br>Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat <br>Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985 <br>All the way live, I think I was about ten <br>One of those happy little niggas singing the blues <br>That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes <br>Sayin Yo momma black his momma this, his momma that <br>Then he get mad and wanna scrap <br>We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike <br>To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows <br>Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets <br>Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket <br>You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles <br>And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's <br>And, all the girls had they turkish link <br>If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it <br>But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce <br>Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>What back in the day When back in the day <br><br>I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87 <br>'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high <br>In 7th grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up <br>No doubt I couldn't wait to get out and be a grownup <br>But let me finish this reminiscing and telling <br>'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys <br>Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks <br>And eating pickles, with tootsie pops <br>And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when JJ Fad hit <br>Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts <br>Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses <br>Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses <br>Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with <br>The fat laces cause it was either that or K Swiss <br>I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk <br>Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework <br>It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone <br>And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but <br>Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then <br>Think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>What back in the day When back in the day <br><br>Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up <br>Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding <br>Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing <br>You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made <br>But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central LA <br>That's where I stayed and figured a way out <br>I gave it all I had so for what it's worth <br>I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first <br>So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up <br>Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid <br>And we finally did, but <br>Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then <br>Think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when
