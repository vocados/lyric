Like your hair, man. Gray." <br>He laughed and said, "Okay, okay." <br>I said, "Hey, I got a little gray too. I'm not picking on you. But please just tell the guy at Home Depot gray and let them pick the color." <br>Fingers crossed that he gets it right <br><br>It was a long weekend and I went to bed and I just woke up from a long sleep <br>I dreamed I was invited to Farrah Fawcett's house <br>It was a big, beautiful house somewhere in California <br>There were maybe ten people there, none of whom I knew <br>Though Farrah was older, she looked just liked she did in Charlie's Angels <br>And she was kind and a wonderful host <br>Her house was enormous with lots of glass and light <br>And a nice open living room <br>I took a walk outside and all the land around our house was rolling hills leading to the Pacific Ocean <br>The land looked something like a cross between Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur, and Point Reyes <br>With beautiful orange flowers for days and days <br>The ocean was off in the distance a bit but I walked down there <br>And when I got the ocean, it wasn't the ocean anymore <br>But a river <br>There were two couples fishing who didn't appear to know what they were doing <br>One of the girls said she caught a fish but was struggling to reel it in <br>I offered to help and she gave me the pull and warned me that the gear had been rented <br>The line seemed like it was snagged on something <br>As I was pulling, I noticed a small boat floating towards us <br>Holy fuck, her hook was caught on a small boat and I was reeling the boat in <br>I didn't know why I didn't think to cut the line <br>I guess it was sort of fun catching a boat and everyone was laughing <br>When the boat finally got to the shore <br>It crashed fairly hard onto a dock <br>But not too hard <br>Of all things, a few people were inside <br>I entered the boat to discuss the damage with them <br>They laughed and said not to worry about it <br>That the fishing pole probably took more of a beating than the boat <br>I thanked them and when I jumped off the boat the girl looked petrified <br>I said, "Aw, god, I'm really sorry to tell you this but the boat owners want to sue. They said there's quite a lot of damage in there, many of their belongings as well as the motor and some damage to the back of the boat." <br>She began sobbing and I immediately hugged her and said, "Nah, nah, I'm just kidding. It's okay, there's no damage. They're super nice people and they even offered to give you a new fishing pole if yours was damaged." <br>She said, "Aw, god," she took a deep breath, then she said, "Let's just get the fuck out of here."]]></content><category term="Sun Kil Moon" label="Sun Kil Moon"/><category term="Seventies TV Show Theme Song" label="Seventies TV Show Theme Song"/></entry><entry><id>http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Vague_Rock_Song/</id><title>Sun_Kil_Moon - Vague Rock Song - 가사</title><author><name>lyric</name></author><updated>2018-04-14T08:25:47+09:00</updated><published>2018-04-14T08:25:47+09:00</published><link rel="via" href="http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Vague_Rock_Song/" title="Sun_Kil_Moon - Vague Rock Song - 가사"/><content type="html"><![CDATA[This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody sing along <br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody sing along <br><br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody sing along <br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody's gotta have one <br><br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody sing along <br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody's gotta have one <br><br>This is my vague rock song <br>Everybody sing along <br><br>Sounds like a little like Biz Markie <br>Or Cypress Hill with a little bit of me <br><br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br>Come now, everybody dance <br><br>Watch out right here <br>You weren't expecting this <br>Frank Zappa part <br>This little part's gonna be good, this little part's gonna be good <br>Let's go to Africa <br>Rumble in the jungle <br><br>I hope you like my vague rock song <br>And that you aren't too terribly bummed <br>I hope you like this vague rock song <br>I feel it's one that you can hum <br>And the words are not too many or too fast <br>I feel it's something that everyone can grasp <br>You gotta have a vague rock song <br>In your catalog that everyone can sing along <br><br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance (Come on) <br>Come now, everybody dance <br><br>Went on a walk today <br>Stopped at the gym and I lifted some weights <br>I'm middle-aged and feeling out of shape <br>Don't wanna look like a California raisin <br>It's the natural evolution of life <br>Gotta lay off bread, pasta, and white rice <br>Gotta get outta bed sometime and break a sweat <br>Doc says I need to diet and a steady exercise regiment <br><br>On the way to the studio I stop into a store <br>The woman was staring at a TV that was blaring <br>I said, "Dan, what's going on?" <br>She said, "A chlorine attack in Syria.

The Sun Kil Moon show at Dachstock Reitschule, Bern, the open space in front of our house Reitschule, Bern is causing increasing troubles with violence and sexes. An organized drug dealer and the [?] we decided to shut the place down and its ongoing activities. For a while, at least ten days, or maybe longer and find a way of how to deal with our society's problems erupted in front of our house, creating a rather explosive atmosphere at times in front of our house. We're very sorry that due to this reaction the show with Sun Kil Moon will have to be cancelled. As we're in general enforcing this temporary shutdown, apologies for any inconveniences to you, I know your band just got into town. Of course we're gonna pay full agreed guaranteed fee as well as covering your hotel for 12/7/16. Also tickets will be reimbursed, it can be used to see your show tonight in Zrich. We strongly hope you reschedule your concert in Bern next time your band is touring in Europe. Reitschule remains closed until further notice. Again, my deepest apologies, but it's totally out of my control.

We watched Drugstore Cowboy and Butch gave Caroline tips on how to cook a turkey. She thought Butch was charming and sweet and he really took to her too. Matt Dillon's character in Drugstore Cowboy was after Dilaudid, the Holy Grail of pharmaceuticals. Butch knew what Dilaudid was. He was older than me so there were things you didn't have to explain to Butch. There were things he just got and understood. When someone is older than you always take the time to listen to them. A person older than you knows something that you don't. At the very least Butch knew what it meant to be black and born in 1952. Do you? Because I don't know shit about that. I remember the wood burning stove and the heat was really cranking in the living room. Nathan kept getting up to remove himself from the heat and to have a smoke outside. But Butch didn't budge unless he needed to go to the bathroom. Butch wasn't the agile mother fucker he used to be and he needed a damn good reason to get up off of that cozy chair. Butch's favorite part of the turkey was the drumstick and when they left, at around midnight or so, Butch took almost all the leftovers with him. That was Butch. If he was in your backstage area forget it. He had a relentless hunger and thirst and he cleaned your backstage area out <br><br>(Verse 2) <br>Butch makes sure no one stole no microphones <br>Butch makes sure that safely, you return home <br>Butch makes sure no one stole your keys to your car or your wallet <br>Butch makes you clean your own fucking piss off the toilet <br>There's no fucking around with Butch <br>He'd shake you down <br>He'd put you in check until you felt like a fucking clown <br>Every day he'd watch the pigeons flutter <br>He saw the bums sleeping in the gutter <br>And San Francisco’s tenderloin <br>He walked the streets but I couldn't say if he felt joy <br>And when my time comes for me to die <br>I hope I see Butch again and to pass some time <br>I'm sorry man I didn't get a chance to say goodbye <br>But I hope you like my little Butch lullaby <br>I'm sorry man that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye <br>But I hope you like my little Butch lullaby <br>This one's for you <br>This one's for you <br><br>This one's for you (Butch) <br>This little lullaby (x10) <br><br>(Butch) Butch was the resident mayor of the tenderloin <br>(Butch) Butch was into Red Hot Chili Peppers Funky Monks video <br>(Butch) Butch threatened a guy with a machete who was messing with (?) <br>(Butch) Butch was there when I cut Old Ramon in the studio <br><br>(Spoken) <br>May 28th, 12:58 AM, 2016 <br>I'm just back from Butch's memorial. I stopped and got a bouquet of poppies along the way. It was a sparse attendance when I first showed up but it filled up pretty quickly. I stayed out back for a while in the alley with a handful of people sharing stories about Butch almost directly under the room where he died. Stories ranged from Butch chasing people with sickles, to his times with George Clinton, to his always entertaining mood swings people encountered over the years. I asked a friend when it was exactly that Butch began working at Hyde Street and he said that Butch turned up with George Clinton's entourage about 20 years ago or so. That he just never left. He said that there were several times he wanted to strangle Butch but that he had an unexplainable affection for him that kept him around. Everyone had a lot of love for Butch, but seemed to have experienced some kind of confrontation with him except for me. All of my experiences with him over the years were pleasant and I asked someone why that was <br>Somebody said, "Because you're Mark Kozelek" <br>And I said, "No seriously really" <br>And they said, "Well, that's because you never told him what to do" <br>That was correct. In all the years I've known Butch I have no memory of ever telling him what to do. I mean I've seen him get serious and angry before but it was always out of protectiveness and he was never hostile towards me. At some point a couple asked me if I wanted to go smoke a joint with them, with a group of people, up in the echo chamber. I said well I don't smoke pot but sure, I'd be happy to join them and that I hadn't been in the echo chamber for years. The last time I was in the echo chamber it had been a storage room filled with amps and 10 inch tapes. We went up there and a girl liked the way her singing voice sounded with all that echo. She sounded like Janis Joplin and we all hummed along and tapped our feet as a joint that looked like a small wet cigar got passed around. When we left the room several of the people began climbing the long ladder that leads to the roof. They asked me to join but I said, "No fucking way, I'm too old". It was late and I was ready to go home. As I left a band was playing in the main room and lots of pizza boxes were everywhere and beers all around and girls were dancing. Butch would've loved it. I hugged a few familiar faces goodbye and headed out onto Hyde Street into the heart of the Tenderloin like I've done so many times over the years. This time Butch didn't follow me out like he would often do asking me to buy him a 40]]></content><category term="Sun Kil Moon" label="Sun Kil Moon"/><category term="Butch Lullaby" label="Butch Lullaby"/></entry><entry><id>http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Sarah_Lawrence_College_Song/</id><title>Sun_Kil_Moon - Sarah Lawrence College Song - 가사</title><author><name>lyric</name></author><updated>2018-04-14T08:26:02+09:00</updated><published>2018-04-14T08:26:02+09:00</published><link rel="via" href="http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Sarah_Lawrence_College_Song/" title="Sun_Kil_Moon - Sarah Lawrence College Song - 가사"/><content type="html"><![CDATA[Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song, this is my <br>Sarah Lawrence College song <br><br>8: 02 AM, April 25th, 2016, New York <br>Everything went fine at Sarah Lawrence College <br>While I was on stage I asked the kids to educate me on what exactly it is that they study there <br>A person shouted: <br>"We do whatever the hell we want" <br>I replied, "Well, that's what I've been doing all my life." <br>I asked what their parents payed for them to do whatever the hell they want and a girl in the front row said: <br>"$60, 000 a year" <br>I said, "Well, that's what Walmart pays me to use my music in commercials and that maybe I could go to their school one day too 'cause they all seem like really nice people." <br>I explained that Kirk Hammett from Metallica went to college after Metallica made it, which was met with a thud <br><br>A nice girl named Sophie played piano on a few songs with us because my mic couldn't reach the piano <br>She played the four notes on "Richard Ramirez..." and "Carry Me Ohio" really, really, well <br>That was a lot of fun <br>We also played "When Doves Cry" in honor of Prince, who died the night before <br>Steve Shelley played drums with me that night, by the way <br>What a great drummer <br>Steve's also a really nice guy <br>Great acoustics in the room and the show went really well <br>And we got out of there by midnight <br>What a cool group of kids and a nice promoter named Max <br>It was the first show he ever promoted and he gave me a check in an envelope, which I actually didn't open until just now here in my New York hotel three nights after the gig <br>This is what his note said: <br><br>"Dear Mark, first of all thank you so much for playing Sarah Lawrence College. Even though we have a really small school and don't get much attention, we have a really lot of passionate kids. I know every single one of them is thrilled to have you come. Your music means so much to so many. I first heard your music when I was searching songs about Los Angeles <br>For a project in high school. I was fifteen or sixteen, and I came across "Cruiser" and it changed everything for me. It was the music I had been searching for for a long time. Some people say your music makes them sad and that you make sad music. I don't know, I guess I disagree. Your music was and is a comfort to me. I feel a sort of connection to it that is less a melancholic thing but more a reassuring thing <br>I was taking a seven-hour train across the state of New York. I listened to the entirety of Benji and Red House Painters I back-to-back. I thought of a lot of things when I listened to those records. And somehow it brought me ease to know someone that was thinking some of those same things. It was calming and even though I'm writing this letter before you even take the stage, I know the scene you perform tonight will be one of my most enjoyable moments. So thank you again so much for coming, I hope you had a nice time <br>And I hope this letter finds you well. Looking forward to the next record, the Jesu/Sun Kil Moon LP was great.

His walls were graffitied with the word "Loser." <br>A small CD collection was found, including compact discs by Pete Yorn, Jet, Hot Hot Heat, Veruca Salt, Temple of the Dog, The Donnas, and Thirty Seconds to Mars. <br>All CDs were still in the shrink wrap, unopened, except for Hot Hot Heat. <br>Burt's flip-phone was filled with texts to a 666 area code phone number. <br>One to Louisiana prefix. All texts said, "Go away." His phone was also filled with photos of cats and payphones. <br>The objects used to kill his victim were a '59 reissued Les Paul guitar made by Epiphone and an antique ice pick bought at an Alameda flea market. <br>No other weapons were found in the cabin. <br>Other items collected were a 24-inch flat-screen TV, boxing blooper videotapes, a VCR, and sports clothing designed by Under Armour. <br>Burt Clossin is now serving a triple life sentence plus five years for the death of Dad Rock Slowhand Simpleton in California's Corcoran Prison. <br>Burt claimed that his motive for the murder was triggered Simpleton's singing voice, which, according to Burt, sounded too much like, quote, "The guy who sang "Wonderful Tonight." <br>"Wonderful Tonight," an Eric Clapton ballad from the album Slowhand was Burt's 7th grade sweetheart's favorite song. <br>"She dumped me," Burt told investigators, "for a rich kid with a pontoon boat."]]></content><category term="Sun Kil Moon" label="Sun Kil Moon"/><category term="The Highway Song" label="The Highway Song"/></entry><entry><id>http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Philadelphia_Cop/</id><title>Sun_Kil_Moon - Philadelphia Cop - 가사</title><author><name>lyric</name></author><updated>2018-04-14T08:26:11+09:00</updated><published>2018-04-14T08:26:11+09:00</published><link rel="via" href="http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/Sun_Kil_Moon/Philadelphia_Cop/" title="Sun_Kil_Moon - Philadelphia Cop - 가사"/><content type="html"><![CDATA[Walking to my girlfriend's in Telegraph with a hand full of roses <br>Stopped through a corner store, on the TV a Philadelphia cop shot by ISIS <br>30, 000 people murdered in the USA in 2015 <br>And when I go in the studio later today we're gonna put up a mic and about this I might sing <br>See I don't give a fuck about things like who's the best or the worst on Twitter <br>And the other social media, money-making scheme turning you into a zombie <br>Jerking you off, masturbator, procrastinator <br>While the kids in Silicon Valley take your money and say, "Can we get the check, waiter?" <br>While they bulldoze your favorite building in town and turn it into a fucking fruit shake maker <br>You got the brains to be the next Norman Mailer <br>You got the longevity to be the next Elizabeth Taylor <br>You got the class to be the next James fucking Spader <br>You got the swagger to be the next Stiv fucking Bator <br>But are you sitting on the toilet staring at your phone like a perfectly tailored, made-to-order puppet <br><br>I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet <br><br>I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet <br><br>Okay, so here I am, back home <br>I'm gonna read another chapter of this book, Beatlebone <br>The part so far that's made me the most smile is the page that has multiple uses, uses of the word "wily" <br>That's me, a wily motherfucker <br>Come to Massillon and that's what you get, sucker <br>Gimme a one out of five, a big fat ten <br>Give me a two, either way it's all after me <br>And to all of you I say: <br><br>"Oh my God, you're a music journalist!

hear a Spanish radio in the basement talk, talk, talking <br><br>I smell the sardine can from the meal I've just eaten <br>Gonna put this pen down, stare off into the sky, dreaming with my heart is the world's biggest smile <br>For the hell of it I'm gonna read a random passage from the Bible <br>It's been in this house since the first I owned it <br>It was laying open, swear I'd never touch it but my housekeeper picked it up and closed it <br>So here we go, gonna read just a bit of it <br>Then look off into the pines and let my mind drift <br><br>Chapter 9, St. Luke <br>Christ sends forth his apostles, feeds five thousand with five loaves, is transfigured and casts out a devil. <br>Then calling together the twelve apostles, he gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. <br>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And he said to them: <br>Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. <br>And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there, and depart not from thence. <br>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them <br>And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere <br><br>So there I was, I read a part of the book of Jesus <br>Now I'm eating sunflower seeds and chili lemon peanuts <br>Sipped on a bottle of Glacau smartwater <br>And fell asleep until from upstairs my girl woke me up when she hollered <br><br>12:45 AM <br>SNL, Gwen Stefani, and the short actor guy actor, what's his name? <br>We are the beautiful dead and the beautiful night <br>I love my girl and my home and this miracle of life <br><br>1:04 AM, Vdara Hotel <br>Room 14015, April 9, 2016 <br>Our day started today with many kisses <br>You were on your way out the door to Southern California 'til the fourteenth <br>And I was on my way to Las Vegas, then to New Orleans <br>When you said bye and closed my apartment door behind you <br>A heavy feeling fell upon me, it hit me in a very real way <br>That we'll live the rest of our lives together <br>And that gives me so much happiness and comfort <br>But it also hit me harder than ever before that one day we'll say goodbye for a final time <br>Every day we get closer and closer to death <br>I have no illusions of an afterlife <br>And have no idea how much longer I have on this planet <br>Or what my quality of life will be in five, ten, fifteen years <br>Where will our final goodbye be? What condition will I be in? <br>And how will your health be? Are we even sure we'll be in the same place when one of us has to go? <br>I don't like goodbyes <br>I've had enough last goodbyes with people to know that it's the most painful emotion in the world <br>I don't want to live for eternity, life is filled with too much sorrow <br>My mind keeps flashing to a woman I saw recently <br>Of her and her son asleep in the car on the Tenderloin on a very hot day <br>They were in a tollway zone and looked to be completely passed out <br>She had a big map open on her lap <br>But I knocked on the door and though she couldn't speak to me she was okay <br>My biggest hope in life is that you are beside me when I die <br>I've lived many lifetimes in forty-nine years <br>But the best time of my life is of my days and years spent with you <br>I'm getting older and my stomach is bloated and feels off <br>I burp too much, I'm that middle-aged guy with a gut that I never thought I'd be <br>And here I am in Las Vegas <br>Family men with bellies bigger than mine are walking around with Guns N' Roses t-shirts <br>My elevator was shared with people who've arrived from the Philippines to see the Pacquiao fight <br>How many more times will I fly to Las Vegas? <br>I saw Pacquiao when he was rising <br>In San Francisco in 2000 at Bill Graham <br>Now he's thirty-seven and this might be his last fight <br>My money is on Bradley to win by a decision <br>That's why I'm here, to see what may be Manny's last fight, if in fact he does win <br>I'm getting older and Las Vegas is as wild as ever <br>But I'm tired and I hear the hum of a small refrigerator <br>My mind and my eyes are fading <br>Vdara Hotel, 1:03 PM, April 9th <br>Meeting Tony in the lobby at 2:00 PM for lunch <br>Just turned on CNN <br>"Paris terror fugitive is hitman in Brussels bombing" <br>I woke up at about 9:00 AM <br><br>Terrible nightmare that Caroline and I were being followed by this creepy lizard-y-looking plastic surgery guy I saw on the plane yesterday <br>He was following us to a hotel <br>But I was diplomatic, turned around, and told him we'd meet him on the balcony of some bar nearby <br>When we arrived and talked to him, he started throwing insults at me <br>And I knocked his drink out of his hand and into the street <br>He stayed there unfazed <br>Then I grabbed him by his neck, lifting him, pushing him almost, but not quite, over the balcony <br>I told him to go fuck himself and to stay the fuck out of our lives <br>He finally shut his stupid mouth <br>And as we left, Caroline told me that I was good with dealing with creeps <br>That was the end of the dream <br><br>April 10, seat 2E, United Airlines, Las Vegas to New Orleans <br>The fight didn't go as I thought <br>To me, the math added up to Bradley winning by a decision, if it went the distance <br>But Bradley was knocked down twice and lost <br>Bradley had a few moments and I jumped up out of my seat, threw my fists in the air, and got pumped up with excitement <br>But Manny was faster and countered him <br>Manny was the best fighter that night <br>We were in seat 19B, right where the fighters entered and exited <br>I felt bad for Bradley when he passed <br>His trainer Teddy Atlas looked deflated, yet stoic at the same time as he exited <br>Manny's mother and his wife were all smiles when they exited <br>I sat in my chair for a long time after the fight, hemming and hawing about the defeat <br>I owe money on my lost bet <br>The fight hadn't gone as I predicted <br>And that's life]]></content><category term="Sun Kil Moon" label="Sun Kil
