<br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>I remember back in the days <br>When I just a little niggarole <br>I looked up to my bigger bro <br>Begged if I could kick it so <br>When he went out with girls I could go tagging along <br>Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat <br>Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985 <br>All the way live, I think I was about ten <br>One of those happy little niggas singing the blues <br>That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes <br>Sayin Yo momma black his momma this, his momma that <br>Then he get mad and wanna scrap <br>We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike <br>To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows <br>Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets <br>Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket <br>You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles <br>And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's <br>And, all the girls had they turkish link <br>If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it <br>But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce <br>Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>What back in the day When back in the day <br><br>I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87 <br>'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high <br>In 7th grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up <br>No doubt I couldn't wait to get out and be a grownup <br>But let me finish this reminiscing and telling <br>'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys <br>Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks <br>And eating pickles, with tootsie pops <br>And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when JJ Fad hit <br>Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts <br>Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses <br>Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses <br>Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with <br>The fat laces cause it was either that or K Swiss <br>I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk <br>Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework <br>It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone <br>And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but <br>Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then <br>Think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>What back in the day When back in the day <br><br>Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up <br>Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding <br>Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing <br>You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made <br>But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central LA <br>That's where I stayed and figured a way out <br>I gave it all I had so for what it's worth <br>I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first <br>So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up <br>Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid <br>And we finally did, but <br>Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then <br>Think about the years I was raised, back in the days <br><br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br>Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore <br>But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again <br><br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And everybody say I remember way back when <br>And

anyway <br><br>By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, gots many plus plenty <br>String by string, I think I counts like twenty <br>If you loan me a ear, I'll return it with interest <br>If not, I'll simply twist the wrist <br>So listen up closely, with thoughts to recoup me <br>Cause I hope to gross like ten cent per groupie <br>Now only if I had two G's per strand <br>Ask my anchor banker, he understands <br>I used to wrap my hand around a cold gold can <br>Someone once said health is wealth, so check self <br>I gots a perfect check up, 'cept for a hiccup, roll with no stick up <br>How can I keep the goya nectars on my shelf <br>Oh boya how I searched for an employer <br>But before Z L Huckleberry Finn was in Tom Sawyer <br>Now use your imagination, just a smidgen <br>If I was a bird I'd be a pigeon <br>Succumb one to crumbs and pizza crust, when every fella can <br>Eat fresh fish and live fat like pelican <br>Then again, that's only if your capable for freckles <br>Or blue eyes I

<br><br>Now what's up with this peachfuzz nonsense <br>What are y'all talkin about this peachfuzz <br>Nah, I just got one thing to say <br>Ahh man <br><br>By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, six black hairs <br>String by string, I think I counts five pairs <br>That's a little, but still, can I get a thumbs up <br>At least for the peachfuzz that sums up <br>A tidbit, yeah that's it, but who

and I thought life would be a cinch <br>But anyway, anyhow, let's talk about someway somehow <br>That I can make my peachfuzz grow out <br>Really, do I need beard that grows with no pores <br>Just to be respected and resemble Santa Claus <br>Hear this clear, I'm a MAN I tell ya <br>No dreams or drugs like the slugs will I ever sell ya <br>A man I am, in the body of a youth <br>So don't play me

he got a right too <br>Here we go while I check the scene <br>With the Portugese Lover at the age of 14 <br>The same age, front page, no fuss <br>But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us <br>Never been senile, that's where you're wrong <br>But give the man a taste and he's gone <br>Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune <br>I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room <br>I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him <br>For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim <br>Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over <br>I said pop maybe when you're older <br>We laughed all night about the hookers at the party <br>My old man standing yelling good God, almighty <br>Use your condom, take sips of the brew <br>When they reminisce over you, for real <br><br>For real, baby

hair and a short miniskirt <br>I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat <br>I was walkin' through the crowd and gues who I met <br>I whispered in her ear, come to the picture booth <br>So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof <br>I asked her her name, she said blah blah blah <br>She had 9 10 pants and a very big bra <br>I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused <br>I said, how do you like the show <br>She said, I was very amused <br>I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid range <br>But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange <br>Then when I asked, do ya have a man, she tried to pretend <br>She said, no I don't, I only have a friend <br>Come on, I'm not even goin' for it <br>This is what I'm goin' sing <br><br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>And you say he's just a friend, oh baby <br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>But you say he's just a friend, oh baby <br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>But you say he's just a friend <br><br>So I took blah blah's word for it at this time <br>I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime <br>'Cause I have friends and that's a fact <br>Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq <br>Forget about that, let's go into the story <br>About a girl named blah blah blah that adored me <br>So we started talkin', getttin' familiar <br>Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up <br>A relationship or some understanding <br>How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin' <br>Everything sounded so dandy and sweet <br>I had no idea I was in for a treat <br>After this was established, everything was cool <br>The tour was over and she went back to school <br>I called every day to see how she was doin' <br>Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin' <br>I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again <br>I said, yo, who was that Oh, he's just a friend <br>Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that <br>Jus' bust this <br><br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>And you say he's just a friend, oh baby <br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>But you say he's just a friend, oh baby <br>You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend <br>But you say he's just a friend <br><br>So I came to her college on a surprise visit <br>To see my girl that was so exquisite <br>It was a school day, I knew she was there <br>The first semester of the school year <br>I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm <br>This guy made me fill out a visitor's form <br>He told me where it was and I as on my way <br>To see my baby doll, I was happy to say <br>I arrived in front of the dormitory <br>Yo, could you tell me where is door three <br>They showed me where it was for the moment <br>I didn't know I was in for such an event <br>So I came to her room and opened the door <br>Oh, snap Guess what I saw <br>A fella tongue kissin' my girl in the mouth <br>I was so in shock my heart went down south <br>So please listen to the message that I say <br>Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend]]></content><category term="Biz Markie" label="Biz Markie"/><category term="Just A Friend" label="Just A

the lyrics, a'ight <br><br>One, and here comes the two to the three and four <br>Then I drop the beat I have in store <br>Lay dynamics on the top like a rug <br>Make it sound smooth and later make a dub <br>Enunciate well, so that you can tell <br>I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit <br>Nothin' like an idiot, get it <br>You want the record, cool, I'm with it <br>Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you <br>As I turn the knob of the door you escape through <br>Go in like a knot, don't be a puff <br>And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough <br><br>It's funky, it's funky X4 <br>Dre makes the beats so fun fun funky <br>It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky X4 <br>Watch the smooth lyrics that take place <br><br>If you want another reason why it must be funky <br>Yo, I am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey <br>So I will play the game like it should be played <br>Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade <br>Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction <br>Brothas say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitchin' <br>No crowd can avoid the D O to the C <br>When I'm P E R F O R M I N G <br>On the stage, see the simple fact is I am dope <br>And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so <br>It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion <br>And I will ascend with the style I am using <br>Knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff <br>I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hittin' funky enough <br><br>Dre make the funky hip hop music so check it <br><br>Listen to the kick, drop in with the click <br>And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses <br>Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on <br>You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on <br>Suckers never come close cause of knowing <br>There is no stopping the DOC when I'm flowin' <br>But in the event that someone will try and juice this <br>Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless <br>I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin' <br>Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money <br>Yo people tell me this, yo Dre you must stop him <br>But with no frills, so I just drop him <br>Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine <br>With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but <br>Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting <br>Let it play when the people say, Dre yo you're getting funky enough <br><br>Deal with the D O to the C <br><br>I need a break so I can check around <br>See who the hell who is sittin' down <br>I want all chairs off the floor <br>And if he stands to the wall, show him the door <br>And the PK nothing giving you something to rock to <br>To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you <br>Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken <br>By a beat so cool you start shaking <br>And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer <br>Haven't seen you're a hellified dancer <br>You tried sittin' but it just won't work <br>Cause the beat is so fresh <br>Don't even tell it won't be funky enough <br><br>And with the help of the Dr Dre, kick it <br><br>It's getting funky on the mix now, right <br>It's getting funky on the mix now, right <br>It's getting funky on the mix now, right <br>It's getting funky on the mix now <br>Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy]]></content><category term="The D.O.C." label="The

can you relate to <br>A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream <br><br>Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen <br>Excuse me but I think I'm about do <br>To get into precisely what I am about to do <br>I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue <br>So listen very carefully as I break it down for you <br>Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed <br>Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed <br>Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes <br>Let me state the position Ladies first, yes Yes <br><br>Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here <br><br>Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see <br>I know all the fellas out there will agree with me <br>Not for being one but for being with one <br>Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some <br>Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on <br>Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting <br>We are the ones that give birth <br>To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First <br><br>I break into a lyrical freestyle <br>Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles <br>Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two <br>Sloppy slouching is something I won't do <br>Some think that we can't flow can't flow <br>Stereotypes, they got to go got to go <br>I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse <br>With what With a

Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb <br><br>Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am <br>Born in L O N D O N and sound American <br>You dig exactly where I'm coming from <br>You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some <br>To enable you to aid yourself and get paid <br>And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay <br>Pay me every bit of your attention <br>Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention <br>I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm <br>Of which is now systematically given <br>Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister <br>Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another <br>Plus one more all four <br>Have a job to do, we doing it <br>Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it <br>And next up is me,

track, waiting for the climax <br>When I get there, that's when I tax <br>The next man, or the next woman <br>It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming <br>And I'll recite the chapter in verse <br>The title of this recital is Ladies First <br><br>Step out into the night <br>Queens of civilization are on the mic <br>The scene is right, the crowd is hype <br>I expel the wack and those who bite <br>Why, cause I'm that type <br>Swaying with beats 45 King style <br>He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile <br>A footnote for the opposite sex <br>Monie ripped the mic, I

heard a scratchy noise <br>On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones <br>It has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism <br>And spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement <br><br>I start to go, my rhymes'll flow <br>So, get up and dance cause Kane said so <br>If you were lounging around it's time to get up <br>Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up <br>I appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer <br>That would dare to compare, I do declare <br>Getting busy is where it's at <br>But what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that <br>Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light <br>But I drop bass just like Barry White <br>So how could you think that you pose a threat <br>You say you're rocking, how many shows you get <br>All your vocals go local on the M I C <br>Mines go a great distance, like ATandT <br>I'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this <br>Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this <br>So, yo, go for what you know <br>Attempt to debate so I can humiliate <br>We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse <br>Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse <br>To take you to your burial ground <br>Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down <br>Correct, I get respect, I'm out to collect <br>Cash money, cause I get raw <br><br>Everybody get up x4 <br>Kane boy do I hate a <br>I'm coming x5 <br><br>Here I am, R A W <br>A terrorist, here to bring trouble to <br>Phony MC's, I move on and seize <br>I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease <br>Cause I'm at my apex and others are below <br>Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo <br>Second to none, making MC's run <br>So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one <br>I relieve rappers just like Tylenol <br>And they know it, so I don't see why you all <br>Try to front, perpetrating a stunt <br>When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt <br>I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi <br>To stage a rage is what rap did to me <br>To make me want to create chaos and mayhem <br>Cold rock a party until the AM <br>I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle <br>While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a <br>Little rhyme with authority, superiority <br>And captivate the whole crowd's majority <br>The rhymes I use definitely amuse <br>Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues <br>I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw <br>Cause I get raw <br><br>Everybody get up x5 <br><br>Give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severing <br>And in my lifetime, believe I've never been <br>Beaten, or eaten and just tooken out <br>You know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out <br>And real nervous when I'm at your service <br>Give me that title, boy, you don't deserve this <br>I work like a slave to become a master <br>And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to <br>Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed <br>The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it <br>I go and flow and grow to let you know <br>I damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro <br>fessional unquestionable without doubt superb <br>So full of action, my name should be a verb <br>My voice will float on every note <br>When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote <br>The minute that the Kane starts to go on <br>Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on <br>As I put other rappers out of their misery <br>Get them in a battle and make them all history <br>Ruling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling <br>Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling <br>On my throne, with a bronze microphone <br>Hmm, God bless the child that can hold his own <br>Cause I get raw <br><br>Ain't it good to you x3 <br>Documentary here's an experiment to begin with <br><br>Twenty four sev chilling, killing like a villain <br>The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing <br>To do whatever is clever, take a loss, never <br>And the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must <br>And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd <br>I rip the microphone and leave it scarred <br>Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff <br>Only crushing MC's that be trying to riff <br>I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic <br>Make MC's panic, they all get frantic <br>And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive <br>As I rock but hey, what you expected <br>I'll get raw for you just like a warrior <br>Rapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I <br>Ever let a Fisher Price MC hang <br>Their rhymes are toy, nothing but yin yang <br>So if we battle on the microphone <br>Bring your own casket and tombstone <br>And I'mma preach your funeral <br>Tell me who in the world could ever come with more <br>I get raw]]></content><category term="Big Daddy Kane" label="Big
