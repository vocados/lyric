brothers feel the same way I feel that’s what I got them for <br>My lows ain’t never been this high <br>Not really complaining cause my karma ain’t never been this good <br>Hard to explain when finding the thinnest line between everything that’s alright <br>And abundant sacrifice that could possibly change your life <br><br>Said I woke up to a song from the birds <br>Walked outside I seen a sunflower grow from the concrete <br>I looked up seen a lightening bug glowing in broad day <br>That’s when it hit me that fear is just and illusion inside me <br>I know my life is beyond me I see my worth everyday <br>I know my people there’s heartbreak written all over your face <br>I went a bought me a mustard seed to remind me of faith <br>And I’ll kick Satan in his ass, tell struggle pardon its way <br>No I won’t let you kill my dream like you did Martin <br>What’s an American dream, when you can’t dream in America <br>No don’t sleep on that balcony they assassinate characters <br>Had to drink a brew or two I swear that shit is unbearable <br>But I’m the living proof of a better you <br>From the letter U, falling down and getting back up <br>Its righteous it makes for a better you <br>It’s time to rewrite history <br>This time we’ll pick a better noose instead of putting it around your neck <br>We gon dangle our success in front of every soul whose heart is grown apart of our neglect <br><br>I just pray you think about me oh darling <br>I just pray you think about me before it’s too late <br>I just pray you make it back home <br>All you got to do is let me know when you’re
