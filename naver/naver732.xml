You Can't Say a Thing (prod. by Milhouse) <br>If you got no validation then lay low <br>All of you, please, stop with the fables <br>Y'all are babies, I'll start rockin' your cradles <br>They lie in their lyrics, but deep inside they know well. Too damn well. <br>I'm the most victimized person in this rap game <br>But I won't rhyme about the details <br>Cuz I got other things to say <br>but still pay attention, I'mma shit on some dumbfucks <br>How many albums have I released? <br>Compare me with those who you admire <br>How much influence did I have in the music industry that went unnoticed? <br>So if he does it, it's swag, and if I do it, it's just playing around with words? <br>People used to shit on me for using "grammatical inversion" (Swings' signature style of punchlines) <br>They treated me like some mentally-ill patient, <br>but now somehow everybody uses it <br>Did I ultimately get the slightest bit of recognition for it, though? <br>Hell fuckin' nah, man. I'm still getting lynched by a mob <br>They talk shit about me in their tracks as if they're gonna kill me <br>But if they encounter me in the streets, they quickly bow their head and disappear <br>What, you ain't got no conscience? What the fuck is wrong with you? <br>Whatever, it's been this way for 8 years. Everyday. <br>In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king, like Fetty Wap <br>Of course, I ain't perfect, and everyone else is a hero, according to their own words <br>But isn't it weird? I feel like I've become Xiahou Dun (a one-eyed military general from Han Dynasty, China, who was popularized by the Chinese epic "Romance of the Three Kingdoms") <br>Fuck your favorite rapper if he don't like me <br>Fuck you, too, and your crew who can't rap for shit <br>I'm motherfuckin' #1, can't you admit it? <br>You still can't tell even after listening to this mixtape? Who're you fuckin' with? <br>Fuck them--CEOs who exploit their label's musicians. <br>And them rappers who hide behind their big bros' back--who are they going to take after? <br>Whoever hates on someone who walks his own way, fuck you, too <br>All the female rappers who can't write their own lyrics, get your game right <br>Fuck the critics who've never taken risk but are so eager to shit on artists <br>Your dream used to be becoming a rapper but you're the ones who failed. <br>Who are you to criticize anyone? To those mofos I'm like, "who that?" <br>I don't care about receiving awards anymore. So how many stars--out of five-- is it gonna be? <br>Everyone has his own opinion, even dogs, cows, and chickens <br>But those who hate on me are all delusional mofos who haven't proven shit in their lives <br>They brainwash Nochang telling him I've made him my slave, <br>and try to get us to argue… (Many Just Music critics have accused Swings of being too harsh on Nochang to work) <br>Please try to understand how I feel about that bullshit <br>If respect rappers who play the game right <br>But is their any rapper who's achieved more than I have? Nada <br>I pushed back buying a whip, and invested in blowing up my label first <br>You think you could've seen Nochang's crazy potentials beneath his seemingly weak appearance? <br>Do you even have the guts to risk shadow boxing against me, when you ain't got a single album? <br>Can you take risks with GIRIBOY or Vasco? <br>I don't think so, no company has ever grouped a bunch of novice rappers and done the crazy shit that I have. <br>Everybody claims to be a battle rapper but it's funny they've never been in a battle <br>They only diss when they're in groups, and everyone always jumps me. <br>I've ripped apart every single battle, and they tell me I'm frontin' <br>And I've only gained victory via rap, but he's tellin' me I'm using my punches <br>Get over your prejudices and think about it. I'm the last standing real man <br>You made the innocent me become a violent man, you scumbag <br>Besides rap, I want to develop as a human being <br>But who has proven the most? Me. <br>So why are you frontin'? Show me some respect <br>Y'all used to hate on Show Me the Money, and now you are all on the show? (Swings went on SMTM season 2 and became a huge rap star, but many rappers in the scene criticized him for selling out) <br>Get your fuckin' money, I truly hope you get rich <br>Why is it cheating only when I do it? Just think before you speak. <br>Oh by the way, I got discharged from the army right? <br>And to you, even if the reason was because I'm ill, it's a lie, huh? <br>Getting the most likes on your hate comment behind the monitor makes you think you've defeated me? <br>Wow, that's real fucking cool dog, go suck a bag of dicks <br>]]></content><category term="스윙스" label="스윙스"/><category term="넌 할 말 없어" label="넌 할 말 없어"/></entry><entry><id>http://lyric.vicharas.net/artist/스윙스/ㅔㅓㅏ_Feat_VASCO_C_Jamm/</id><title>스윙스 - ㅔㅓㅏ (Feat.

The Nail that Stuck Out (prod. by Genius Nochang) <br>When its all said and done there ain't nothin <br>to stop you from being you <br>and my soul tells me to fuck em <br>but my mind finds it hard to do <br>to free myself to free myself <br>to exonerate me <br>to be myself to be myself <br>to exonerate me yea <br>You are a loser who's so prone to judging others. A cockroach who's too scared to enjoy life. <br>I'm the nail that sticks out. Don't try to hammer me in, and then of course I will do the same for you. <br>Whether that girl had plastic surgery or had sex with 500 men, it's the lifestyle she chose. <br>I know that you're only trying to hide your jealousy, so you might as well try harder and sleep with 500 women then. <br>My Caucasian teacher from high school told me <br>a Japanese idiom which can explain Japanese thought. <br>(Swings attended an international high school in Korea, he is referring to a white american <br>male teacher who was actually married to a Japanese woman.) <br>"The nail that sticks out gets hammered down" <br>Regardless of the authenticity of the statement <br>It was shocking how I immediately thought about <br>Korea when I heard him say it <br>Coincidentally this year was 70th anniversary of Korea's independence from imperial Japan. <br>So I asked myself again, 'Are we really free?' <br>Right then and there a kid wearing a school uniform -which is a product of Japan that most Korean schools still observe today- <br>walked right by me. <br>I used to not give a fuck at all. <br>But the word 'maturity' forced me to conform, and slowly I grew apart from my original lifestyle. <br>Yet I still maintained a free-spirit, which can be seen as more tolerant than a lot of liberal minded Americans. <br>This was possible b/c I've always consciously tried to protect myself from extreme conformity. <br>The problem is, I didn't even have to try back then. <br>If you saw and heard of me, I might still look firm and relaxed. <br>But I've always felt so repressed, imprisoned inside my own biases. <br>This song is for you and me, not for the immature or narrow-minded. <br>Cowards dare to tell me, Moon Jihoon (=Swings Korean government) is a pussy <br>It's only a loss for me if I care to make explanations, because you're just a rookie <br>Get on my level, then I will call you 'boss' myself. <br>But you ain't shit. Your words are like helium, there's no weight in it. <br>Just like your loser mentality… I'mma keep fighting <br>I'm going to crush your standards and buy your girlfriend some condoms <br>How about I record her moaning and put it on my song? <br>The melon charts (Korean billboard charts) you envy so much, I'mma fuckin' dominate it fool <br>Hey dumbass, look, your mom's friend's son (a Korean expression for someone who excels at everything) is me right here <br>Wake up, she fucks me hard, bitch where you lookin' at? <br>It's already the seventh time she visited me at my house <br>My sperm is my response for all your bitching <br>I hope you fucking die, motherfucker, you're of no use <br>Why do I have to share the unfortunate life of a scumbag like you? <br>You have neither consciousness nor principles <br>Y'all are motherfuckers just "sucking on the honey" (Korean expression for having it easy) of the society constructed by adults. Yeah, that's who you are <br>Who said "Success lies in changing who I am?" <br>Fuck that shit.
