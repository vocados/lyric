clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt <br>And I shaved my face and combed my hair and, stumbled down the stairs to meet the day <br><br>I'd smoked my brain the night before on, cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin' <br>But I lit my first and watched a small kid cussin' at a can, that he was kickin' <br>Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken <br>And it took me back to somethin', that I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way <br><br>On the Sunday morning sidewalks, wishin' Lord, that I was stoned <br>'Cause there's something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone <br>And there's nothin' short of dyin', half as lonesome as the sound <br>On the sleepin' city side walks, Sunday mornin' comin' down <br><br>In the park I saw a daddy, with a laughing little girl who he was swingin' <br>And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the song that they were singin' <br>Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin' <br>And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday <br><br>On the Sunday morning sidewalks, wishin' Lord, that I was stoned <br>'Cause there's something

<br>Toolin' along in my Chevrolet <br>Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio <br><br>Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line <br>I heard that highway start to whine <br>And I knew that left rear tire was about to go <br><br>Well the spare was flat and I got uptight <br>'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight <br>So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim <br><br>I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car <br>It was right in front of this little bar <br>A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn <br><br>Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat <br>And told the bartender that I had a flat <br>And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one <br><br>There was one thing I was sure proud to see <br>There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me <br>And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone <br><br>I called up the station down the road a ways <br>And he said he wasn't very busy t'day <br>And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so <br><br>He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother <br>Tellin' the durn fool <br>I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go <br><br>I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar <br>When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car <br>With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor <br><br>Well he looked at me and I damn near died <br>And I decided that I'd jus wait outside <br>So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door <br><br>Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin <br>These five big dude come strollin' in <br>With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth <br><br>An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one <br>Said you tip your hat to this lady son <br>An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath <br><br>Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight <br>In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night <br>'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me <br><br>Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick <br>And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick <br>So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee <br><br>He let out a yell that'd curl your hair <br>But before he could move I grabbed me a chair <br>And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man <br><br>Well you may not know it but this man's a spy <br>He's an undercover agent for the FBI <br>And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan <br><br>He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee <br>But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me <br>And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went <br><br>I said would you beleive this man has gone as far <br>As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars <br>And he voted for George McGoveren for president <br><br>Well he's a friend of them long haired hippie type pinko fags <br>I betcha he's even got a Commie flag <br>Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage <br><br>He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys <br>He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise <br>He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage <br><br>They all started lookin' real suspicious at him <br>And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim <br>You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life <br><br>I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch <br>And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church <br>And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife <br><br>Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed <br>But I didn't wait around to hear the rest <br>I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck <br><br>And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks <br>And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks <br>So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up <br><br>Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud <br>Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd <br>Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot <br><br>An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run <br>But somehow I couldn't resist the fun <br>Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot <br><br>Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas <br>And spun around and headed them off at the pass <br>Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air <br><br>Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin' <br>Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin' <br>But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there <br><br>When I hit the road I was really wheelin' <br>Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin' <br>An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas <br><br>I think I'm gonna re route my trip <br>I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped <br>If I went

my blue eyed son <br>Oh, where have you been, my darling young one <br>I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains <br>I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways <br><br>I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests <br>I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans <br>I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, and it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, what did you see, my darling young one <br>I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it <br>I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it <br><br>I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' <br>I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin' <br>I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken <br>I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>And what did you hear, my blue eyed son <br>And what did you hear, my darling young one <br>I heard the sound of a thunder, is it roared out a warnin' <br>Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world <br><br>I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin' <br>I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin' <br>I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' <br>I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter <br>I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley <br><br>And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>And who did you meet, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, who did you meet, my darling young one <br>I met a young child beside a dead pony <br>I met a white man who walked a black dog <br><br>I met a young woman whose body was burning <br>I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow <br>I met one man who was wounded in love <br>I met another man who was wounded with hatred <br><br>And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall <br><br>Oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son <br>Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one <br>Well, I'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin' <br>Well, I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest <br><br>Where the people are many and their hands are all empty <br>Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters <br>Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison <br>Where the executioner's face is always well hidden <br><br>Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten <br>Where black is the color, and none is the number <br>And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it <br>And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it <br><br>And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' <br>But I'll know my song well before I start singin' <br><br>And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard <br>It's a hard rain's a gonna fall]]></content><category term="Joan Baez"
